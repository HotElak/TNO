 BOV_Dmytro_Klyachkivsky: "Дмитро Клячківський"

 POLITICS_DMYTRO_KLYACHKIVSKY_DESC: "Вірність. Доблесть. Жертовність. Цінності, які Степан Бандера вважав необхідними для свободи, а Дмитро Клячківський палко наслідував. З волі Бандери він очистив Галичину і Волинь від виродків, які заплямували українську землю. Коли вождь Коновалець піддався хворобі, вони згуртували народ проти архізрадника Мельника, який вклонявся німцям, поки ті грабували Україну.\n\nВідданість. Доблесть. Жертовність. Цінності, які давно втрачені. Клячківський одягнув бандерівську мантію, щоб очолити Українську Повстанську Армію. Перша боротьба була кривавою, і багато людей впало від гніву Німецької сталі. У той час як справжні революціонери продовжували боротися, слабкодухі дезертирували. Друга боротьба була успішною, поки не повернулися безхребетні дворняги, які служили райхскомісару за недоїдки, а дехто навіть перейшов до республіканізму. Орди зрадників перемогли їх, і Клячківський помститься.\n\nВідданість. Відвага. Жертовність. Цінності, які необхідно відновити. Український народ знемагає в кайданах, скутий зрадниками та їхніми іноземними господарями. Врятувати його може лише справжня сила, а не декадентські ліберали, не соціялістичні євреї і не іноземні таргани. Вони - хвороба, яку треба викорінити, отруйна зараза, яку можна очистити лише в полум'ї бою. Україна не буде вільною, поки не буде виконана воля Бандери."
 POLITICS_ROMAN_SHUKHEVYCH_DESC: "Роман Шухевич, Тур, Тарас Чпринка - все це імена людини, яку переслідує його минуле. Він був українським золотим хлопчиком для німців, омитим кров'ю. Він був офіцером батальйонів «Нахтіґаль», що чинили погроми проти євреїв Львова. Він був гауптманом батальйону шуцманшафт 201, брав участь у вбивстві десятків тисяч поляків під час різанини на Галичині та Волині. Нагородою за ці «антипартізанські заходи» стала зрада з боку німців і зміцнення їхньої влади над Україною.\n\nТакою є його історія, він може не пишатися нею, але вона є частиною його самого. Для Шухевича примирити своє минуле як колабораціоніста і теперішнє як борця опору дуже просто. Мотиви, які пов'язували ці два життя, не змінилися - кожен його вчинок був спрямований на світлу Україну. Саме за теперішнє і майбутнє він бореться. Очищення кліки Клячківського і Стецька було необхідним, адже вони вже відштовхнули від себе стільки потенційних союзників у боротьбі з Німеччиною. Дім, розділений сам проти себе, не може встояти, а український дім стоїть у сантиметрах від прірви. Єдність - це все, що залишилося, що може її врятувати, якщо ще не пізно..."
 POLITICS_YAROSLAV_STETSKO_DESC: "Мораль не має місця в ідеальному світі Ярослава Стецька. Вона була стерта разом з багатьма іншими ідіотськими поняттями, коли він прокинувся до істин бандерівської мудрості в ніжному віці. Саме тоді він зрозумів своє призначення - присвятити своє життя вільній і чистій Україні. Таким тарганам, як Сціборський, не вистачало волі - він же був вільний, готовий позбавити свою націю від забруднювачів - від євреїв, комуністів і всіх інших менших рас.\n\nНімеччина, можливо, і вирішила ці проблеми, але Україна залишилася борсатися в бруді, потерпаючи від неналежної опіки з боку цього невігласа-расиста Коха. Грубий, поглинутий власними упередженнями, він не знав про праці Липи, які доводили, що українці мають ту саму генетичну приналежність, що й німці. Проте Кох тримав їх у рабстві, відкидаючи науку, аж поки УПА не була змушена довести силу своєї раси.\n\nНарод обрав його, щоб стати українським Гітлером, позбавити свою націю від хвороби і перетворити націоналізм на націонал-соціялізм. Земля Стецька стане раєм, з якого посміхнеться сам Бандера. Лише тоді Німеччина побачить помилковість своїх шляхів і прийме Україну як брата, незабаром об'єднавшись у боротьбі проти юдо-більшовизму."
 POLITICS_STEPAN_LENKAVSKYI_DESC: "Починається найвідоміший твір Степана Ленкавського: «Здобудеш українську державу або згинеш у боротьбі за неї». Тепер, оточений зрадою з усіх боків, Ленкавський впевнений, що виконає цю обіцянку.\n\nЦя праця, «Декалогом українського націоналіста», була лише однією з багатьох статей і заяв, які Ленкавський написав у перші роки існування ОУН. Він був запеклим і радикальним націоналістом, донцовцем у душі, який вірив ні в що інше, як у повну українську зверхність.\n\nПотім прийшла Друга світова війна, і з'явився шанс довести свою силу. Він не стримався. Спочатку він працював з німцями, стояв поруч з їхніми ескадронами смерті під час погромів. Потім, коли вони зрадили справу, він дав їм відсіч, як звірам, якими вони були. Відтоді потік крові був нескінченним, і він ніколи не припиняв проливати її далі.\n\nБагато в чому кар'єра Ленкавського навряд чи була унікальною для його організації. Проте щоразу, коли йому надавалася можливість пом'якшити свої погляди або змінити методи, він робив це з подвійною енергією. Його бачення України загострилося, очистилося. Якщо хтось хоче його змінити, він може посперечатися з його кулями."

 BOV_Roman_Shukhevych_hog_desc: "§YDeputy Commander-in-Chief\nRevolutionary Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LRoman Shukhevych, in his own words, is a patriot - a man who will do anything in the fight for a free and powerful Ukraine, serving as the second-in-command of the UPA and as one of their most experienced generals. To others, he is a traitor turned twice, first on his own, then on the Germans. A bloodthirsty brute who justifies slaughtering thousands of Poles as a means to an end.\n\nPrevented from assuming leadership of the OUN after Bandera's death due to ideological purity, Shukhevych compromised with his opponents to maintain unity.\n\nDespite this, he is a man who finds himself at odds with Klyachkivsky's fanaticism, Shukhevych feels he must act, but reluctance clouds his every thought. Backstabbing Klyachkivsky and abandoning the Permanent Revolution would make him no better than Melnyk.\n\nBut years of German exploitation have taken their toll on the nation, and even the UPA must compromise on their old ways. Real patriots understand that Ukraine's survival is more important than petty political squabbles, only time will tell if the rest of the UPA can.§!"
 BOV_Stepan_Lenkavskyi_hog_desc: "§YFirst Minister to the Vozhd\nUltranationalism§!\n--------------\n§LAuthor of the Commandments of the Ukrainian Nationalist, Stepan Lenkavskyi has been an ally of Bandera from the earliest beginnings of the infamous revolutionary. A skilled administrator and the de facto leader of civilian affairs, Lenkavskyi approaches his work with the fiercest of zeal, for the Permanent Revolution cannot succeed abroad if it fails at home. As Klyachkivsky's right-hand man, he'll see their bloody task completed, no matter the cost.§!"
 BOV_Dmytro_Myron_for_desc: "§YHead of the Political Department\nUltranationalism§!\n--------------\n§LA close ally of Lenkavskyi and Bandera, Dmytro Myron has served faithfully as an ideologist for the OUN-B and UPA. Myron has always been an ardent advocate for the supreme power of the nation-state, and serves as a propagandist, encouraging Ukrainians within and without her borders to rise against their oppressors so Ukraine may be one from the San to the Caucasus. With the carnage of war on the horizon, Myron once more stokes the hearts of Ukrainians to face their oppressors.§!"
 BOV_Vasyl_Halasa_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nUltranationalism§!\n--------------\n§LVasyl Halasa is not a man unfamiliar with poverty and hardship, having been a brickmaker as a child to help support his family when his father died. He pursued an education in economics, only having half completed it before joining the OUN and UPA and partaking in their massacres.. As Klyachkivsky readies the nation for conquest, Halasa must fuel it by any means necessary. Even with his insufficient education, there can be no room for doubt, it's prosper or perish.§!"
 BOV_Mykhailo_Medvid_sec_desc: "§YRegional Commander\nUltranationalism§!\n--------------\n§LMykhailo Medvid is a true exemplar of the Permanent Revolution. As a close subordinate of Klyachkivsky, Medvid successfully performed operations that trained soldiers, developed communications, and built public support. As officers gave their lives for the struggle, Medvid took their place, showing further talent as a commander and a fervent dedication to liberation. All Ukrainians should aspire to be Medvid, for Medvid aspires for their salvation.§!"
 BOV_Yaroslav_Stetsko_for_desc: "§YHead of Political Education\nNational Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LYaroslav Stetsko is defined by four things, his undying loyalty to Bandera, his deep hatred of communism, his vast intellect, and his complete moral bankruptcy. Stetsko first befriended Bandera following a snub by Stsiborskyi, a slight Stetsko would never forgive. Like Bandera, Stetsko is deeply inspired by Nazi thought, to an extent that people have not yet been able to completely determine.\n\nAs a civilian in a place of authority, Yaroslav Stetsko is in a rare position. A man of supreme intelligence and cunning, he has the unique task of coordinating operations in the logistical nightmare that is the wartorn battlefields of Ukraine. After all, those orders don't reach the men by themselves.\n\nBut Stetsko's own personal biases slip into these communiques like traces of poison being dropped into a well. Every so often, a message containing warnings of Jewish infiltration or advocacy for Germany is sent to each UPA cell. Many ignore it, but each day, more and more find themselves persuaded by Stetsko's appeals for German accommodation in their shared fight against Bolshevism.§!"
 BOV_Vasyl_Kuk_sec_desc: "§YRegional Commander\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\n§LYears of bloody warfare have softened the heart of Vasyl Kuk. The once young and fierce commander of the UPA has become an old, stern partisan. The failures of the Permanent Revolution to unite Ukraine left Kuk a confused soul, and through age and experience, he wizened up to the true suffering of his people. The partisan general seeks nothing more to heal his nation, ideology be damned.§!"

 BOV_Yosyp_Pozychanyuk_for_desc: "§YHead of the Political Department\nPopular Front§!\n--------------\n§LYosyp Pozychanyuk is the leader of a rising movement within the UPA that has embraced reformist ideals to their fullest. As one of the earliest advocates for change, his influence grew among the demoralized troops of the UPA. While his ideas for a united front could be deemed extreme, or even treasonous, it matters not to Pozychanyuk. Victory against the Germans means radical action, even if it might be unthinkable.§!"
 BOV_Volodymyr_Horbovyi_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Finance\nSocial Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LVolodymyr Horbovyi is one of the few remaining members of the Banderite old guard. As a lawyer, he represented their members in court while they operated in Polish-occupied Ukraine. Now, Horbovyi serves as one of the few civilian administrators with significant experience in the UPA. The increasing violence and isolation from the Ukrainian populace has worried the elder lawyer, and he fears that the UPA will be destroyed if it can't correct its course.§!"
 BOV_Rostyslav_Voloshyn_sec_desc: "§YVice Chief of Staff\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\n§LRostyslav Voloshyn is a commander of internal affairs for the UPA with close loyalty to Shukhevych and Pozychanyuk. His single desire is a peaceful Ukraine, free of foreign meddling and suffering, a land where his daughter may live in peace. Voloshyn was driven away by Klyachkivsky's violence, and now he puts his trust in his comrades that they may do better.§!"
 BOV_Lev_Rebet_hog_desc: "§YFirst Minister to the Vozhd\nSocial Nationalism§!\n--------------\n§LLev Rebet is one of the last surviving members of Bandera's old guard. A skilled organizer and administrator got the religious Rebet a spot close to the young revolutionary. Rebet joined Stetsko's plot to collaborate with Germany, seeing it as the only way the UPA could ever truly gain lasting independence. He serves faithfully with a sorrowful smile and an aura of guilt. One can only wonder if Rebet is truly honest, to himself or to others.§!"
 BOV_Dmytro_Maivsky_for_desc: "§YHead of the Foreign Office\nMilitary Junta§!\n--------------\n§LDmytro Maivsky was a general of the UPA who had close ties to Stetsko from the old days of the OUN. His ability to sway others was invaluable in drawing much of the UPA's high command to ally with Stetsko for protection from Klyachkivsky and Lebed's purges. Maivsky now directs his talents to gaining international recognition for the Ukrainian state while keeping the underlings faithful to their cause.§!"
 BOV_Andriy_Piasetsky_eco_desc: "§YHead of the Economic Office\nPaternalism§!\n--------------\n§LAndriy Piasetsky is an oddity among Stetsko's administration. Originally responsible for forest management, his expertise was crucial for protecting the UPA from aerial scouts, and he soon found a friend in Stetsko. Piasetsky's promotion from managing forests to the economy as a whole has been seen as questionable. The forester seeks to prove his dissenters wrong, but fails to realize that his inadequacy is precisely why he is perfect.§!"
 BOV_Mykola_Lebed_sec_desc: "§YChief of the Sluzhba Bezpeky\nNaturalized National Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LMykola Lebed is the shadow master of the Sluzhba Bezpeky. As the man responsible for the OUN and UPA's secret police, it's Lebed's duty to root out all traitors to the Permanent Revolution. Lebed won Klyachkivsky's trust through his brutal and sadistic methods, which allowed his true association with Stetsko to go undetected. Stetsko's ambitions will be realized. There is no sacrifice too great for order and peace.§!"
 BOV_Slava_Stetsko_for_desc: "§YHead of the Foreign Office\nNaturalized National Socialism§!\n--------------\n§LThey say behind every great man is a great woman, and Slava Stetsko certainly sees herself as such. Having married Yaroslav during the long resistance against the Reichskommisariat, Slava has dedicated her life to supporting her husband and the nationalist cause from behind the scenes.\n\nNow, however, she has a chance to take the spotlight, to become the mother of the revived nation. Whilst Yaroslav's infertility has rendered her childless, she will be the model Ukrainian woman, and every girl will aspire to follow her example.§!"

Under Shukhevych, these people will stay by our side, but they will be reminded that their duty is not to their vanity, but to a higher power.\n\nThey will not speak, not because they are broken, but because they see the light."
 
 UKR_BOV_Purged_OUN: "Очищена ОУН"
 UKR_BOV_Purged_OUN_desc: "In the past, the OUN was filled with rot. Those who did not listen, those who did not follow, those who did not trust. A great mass of men and women who refused the call of the Vozhd.\n\n§RTheir end has come.§!"

 BOV_vozhd_commands_desc: "The story of Ukraine is one of pain, humiliation, betrayal, and destruction. Far too many have claimed the mantle to reverse this, and all have been found wanting. But this has changed, and a path to victory has revealed itself. As long as the people do not waver. As long as the people trust.\n\nThe Vozhd has made his vision of freedom clear, and his orders will return fire to the nation and strength to the populace. That freedom will be delivered, if the people will only join him in fraternity and focus. Ukraine will be whole again.\n\nTrust in the Vozhd!"
 BOV_dissent_dark_desc: "The Ukrainian is inherently intolerant of oppression, and yearns for freedom from foreign control of any sort. The Ukrainian is strong and stubborn, and the Vozhd, glorious as he is, understands and shares this valorous trait. He also understands how to emphasize it.\n\nMany prospective heroes of Ukraine have already broken their imposed chains, and fight in their own ways for emancipation. The Vozhd must, can, will rally them, show them the most worthy cause they can dedicate themselves to and, in turn, sow the seeds of general insurrection."
 BOV_rage_ranks_desc: "It is said that the Vozhd's soldiers are little more than farmers with rifles, untrained and incapable of modern warfare. This overlooks their most important characteristic - rage. Blinding, overwhelming rage, supported by loyalty, determination, and patriotism unmatched anywhere else in the world.\n\nThese qualities must be emphasized, exemplified, and demonstrated to those who doubt the absolute dedication of the Vozhd and his soldiers to secure freedom for Ukraine and its people. We will not be silent. We will not be passive. We will not be controlled."
 BOV_bloody_fray_desc: "It is finally time. After years of rebuilding, of running, of hiding, we will do so no more. The Vozhd, glorious as he always is and shall remain, has finished his visionary plans for the Third Struggle, and our enemies know not how close they are to destruction.\n\nAll the Vozhd must do is present the plan to his loyal subordinates, so that they may carry it to the front lines - and light the spark that has laid dormant for so long."
 BOV_connections_faithless_desc: "As detestable as he may be, Stetsko is correct in one thing - he does have connections. Traitorous elements - who will be justly served in good time and measure - have greatly weakened our ties both to our brothers and to the people outside of the occupied lands.\n\nWe must rebuild these ties if we are to succeed in the battles ahead, as their support and facilitation will be critical beyond measure. We must therefore listen to Stetsko, and work to follow his suggestions. Sacrifices must be made to achieve the glorious future desired."
 BOV_carnage_righteous_desc: "As our plan finalizes, so too does the conviction of Stetsko and Shukhevych that there remain numerous problems inherent in it. They can continue to 'fix' them if desired, but the Vozhd will no longer be denied - and he will begin the Third Struggle.\n\nThe efforts of the Vozhd will themselves lay the groundwork for ultimate victory and, once achieved, will forever preclude any more 'questioning' of his plans. None will dare challenge him again."
 BOV_charisma_treacherous_desc: "Shukhevych has been a problem from the very start, always speaking his mind - openly, no less - about the inadequacy of our soldiers, arms, and preparations. Insinuating, ever so carefully, that the Vozhd has made errors. He would have been replaced but, unfortunately, his popularity among the officers and his admittedly significant military talent affords him protection.\n\nHe will keep his place - and his head - for now. He will work to solve our problems, and he may speak as he wishes. But all will be recorded. All will be remembered."
 BOV_patriots_poland_desc: "No matter how many guns we have, and how much the common populace may or may not support us, there is one thing we will always require - fighters. They are difficult to find, and even harder to motivate. But some have been found - scattered in and around the Generalgovernment.\n\nThere they - Polissians, Poles, Kubiyovych and his ilk, and others - fight with the Germans. They strike outposts, rail lines, collaborators, and others. If we can restore contact, if we can rebuild relationships, they may yet serve and assist the cause. Even if it is only as a distraction to the hated occupiers."
 BOV_unleash_sluzhba_bezpeky_desc: "Though immensely saddening, it is a matter of fact that our movement is not free of its own criminals, traitors, and unreliable elements - and to deal with them effectively the Sluzhba Bezpeky must be properly empowered and supported. Currently it is not, and this threatens not only Bandera's wishes but also his great vision for our future.\n\nTheir role is critical, and this degradation of their capability cannot be allowed to continue. They need a fresh breath of life, they need resources. We will provide them."
 BOV_galicia_forays_desc: "Centuries ago, Europe suffered under the black plague due to their lack of knowledge of the impact rats and vermin can truly cause on civilized society; Disease, rot and decay, the breakdown of order, and ultimately death is what follows any state that ignores the threat the vermin can bring to them, be they literal or metaphorical.\n\nThe Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army is such vermin, a taint that touches every good Ukrainian, distorting their mind, and yet even cockroaches have the sense to not be prideful of their loathsome existence, something that even the UNRA fails at. It's time we smoke out these pervasive syncophants from Galicia like one would do to a rat warren."
 BOV_instill_commandments_desc: "Nothing instills more pride in being Ukrainian than a march of proud, steel-faced soldiers, weapons held high, nothing but pride and love for our flag and utter contempt to any that would dare besmirch it, those people that are malleable, fickle and too embroiled in fear, sloth, and greed.\n\nGaze upon our flag! Look at the beauty of our land, our pure people! Our Vozhd, our history, our lineage! This pride, this joy in our nation is something we can't ever grasp, but to even encapsulate the magnitude of the love we should feel for Ukraine is too much for a mere individual.\n\nBut our soldiers will not be mere individuals. Theirs is a collective mind, a realm that this love will fill wholly, push away anything that is unnecessary to it, until they are as zealous and dutiful as our magnanimous leader."
 BOV_insurgency_years_desc: "Since the dawn of the Nazi occupation, the UPA has had many brave souls who have fought for Ukraine, some still fighting since the revolutions of 1917. Ukraine's greatest army is deeply privileged to bear witness to such patriots fighting on our behalf, but we must not waste this privilege. Not all our newest recruits are trained in even a quarter of the skills that these soldiers are, and it's high time we change that.\n\nThe best of our best need to train those newest recruits of ours, lest the masses of our armies remain untrained rabble. Through training these men in skills only our veterans can count themselves knowledgeable in, then and only then can we well and truly prepare for the revolution as we need to. The tactics of the Germans will be taught, the importance of keeping cool will be taught, and plain tips of accuracy will surely become widespread. Before long, this army of ours will know how to shoot and kill better than any Wehrmacht garrison could summon in even its worst nightmares."
 BOV_marshal_craftsmen_desc: "While we are very short on manpower, and can technically arm those soldiers we do employ, to say that we can "arm" them is a very, very generous term considering the weaponry we do have. Many of our soldiers still fight with the weapons of their grandfathers, and even some of our stocks of Mosin-Nagants are older than them.\n\nLuckily, however, these are not the majority, not yet, at least. We do maintain some gunsmiths that keep us armed with relatively modern, Ukrainian weapons. Even still, they are not enough, not yet. Training some of our aspiring gunsmiths in their skills will increase our weapons output significantly- soon, our soldiers will not only be fighting with knives and hunting rifles but genuine Ukrainian automatic weaponry."
 BOV_carpathian_connection_desc: "Many years ago, our brethren in the Carpathians dreamt of a state, a place for the Carpatho-Ukrainians to call their own. For a brief moment that dream was almost realized - before the Hungarians killed it in its cradle. Most moved on and settled. But not all.\n\nSome of them never stopped resisting, and though their numbers are small (and have only dwindled over time), those who remain have skills and knowledge almost beyond compare. We must win their allegiance, and put those qualities to use."
 BOV_steadfast_watchers_desc: "We have fought, bled, and died for years, fighting for the people of Ukraine and for the Permanent Revolution. Most of our people recognize that. Most - but not all. Far too many seem to have forgotten the sacrifices made by us to fight the Germans, and flirt dangerously with the Republican scourge. A reminder is needed.\n\nSome of the most prominent faithless will be located and dealt with, publicly. The people will know that we are both steadfast and watchful, and always ready to excise the cancer of faithlessness."
 BOV_blood_soil_desc: "Let there be no one that claims we haven't given diplomacy a chance.\n\nMany times we've reminded the illegal occupiers to whom the soil they toil truly belonged, the crime of their stay upon our legitimate territory, and as long as they left with their corruptive elements and people, we would be willing to let bygones be bygones; their time would come but not by our hand, as long as they stopped slighting us.\n\nBut so they still stay, breeding like rabbits, despoiling and twisting our history with their mere breath, taunting us by their mere stubbornness and disregard of our warnings! If they love our territory so much, let their blood and bodies be the fertilizer of the next generation of Ukrainians, claiming the land they rightfully deserve."
 BOV_wraiths_night_desc: "The first struggle, years ago, taught us many imperative, costly lessons. The initial mass uprisings were nearly crushed immediately, and those soldiers of ours that survived the repressions or were just plain lucky learned to survive- they had no other choice. The aircraft that bombed us, the tanks that rolled over our barricades, and the patrols that kept us underground all led to our slaughter. And yet?\n\nWe adapted. We learned to sabotage the planes before they even got off the pavement. We learned to throw Zhdanov Cocktails into the exhaust ports of Panzers, and to create IEDs. We learned to hide and ambush the incessant patrols, and to loot them before anyone could realize that the patrols had been wiped off the map. And the Germans haven't forgiven themselves for it since. Even still, not all of these tactics are yet codified, and therefore we need to spread them to all our soldiers on the ground. The Nazis only despise us for all we've done, and we are far from done with them yet."
 BOV_farmer_chemist_desc: "The Panzers that keep the German jackboots on our necks are not invincible, not so like the Luftwaffe, but unlike the Luftwaffe, we have found ways to destroy these armored scourges.\n\nImprovised explosive devices. IEDs, for short, is the perfect solution to the problem of German tanks annihilating our ground forces. The German tanks fear us for what we've been capable of doing to their tanks since the '50s, and that has only come with practice and refinement of our IEDs. It seems that the one material we need the most for these new designs, funnily enough, is fertilizer. Where else can we find fertilizer than from farm slaves? Cooperation with those that have recently broken out or been liberated from plantations can aid us greatly in IED production. Before long, Ukraine will be free from German armor, one Panzer at a time."
 BOV_odessa_operatives_desc: "It is understandable - but most regrettable - that so many of our so-called brothers and sisters have accepted Romanian domination, in Odesa and the territories around it, in order to live free of Nazi tyranny. However, and though few in number, some among them are willing to fight for a free Ukraine.\n\nContact has been made, and they are willing to assist in smuggling weapons through Odesa's connections to the wider world. For a price. One that we are willing to pay."
 BOV_gun_down_guard_desc: "The reach and membership of the Ukrainian National Revolutionary Army is far, far greater than was reported or expected. Operatives of the UNRA have been found everywhere, spread among the lower rungs of state organs. Safehouses and caches have been found in abundance, and it is clear that the UNRA is attempting to turn the Ukrainian people against us.\n\nThis cannot be allowed, and Stetsko has made it clear that if we let their rot spread uncontested it could smother us in short order. We will take action. We will strike the UNRA, and reclaim our position and security."
 BOV_traitors_due_desc: "Although none would argue that the republicans, decadent and bloated as they are, are not a threat to the state, Stetsko focuses all too much upon them, somehow seeing their weakness as strength. In doing so, however, he misses the true threat - the Melnykite Jews, who lined their pockets through German collaboration for years.\n\nThese traitors cannot be excused, and we will not make the same mistake as Stetsko. We will identify the ones to make examples of, and for the rest we will ensure that they know their days are numbered."
 BOV_nationalist_commissariat_desc: "As the national struggle continues, we must remain focused on our ultimate goal - victory - and on what is needed in order to attain it. One such need is dedication. Morale. Commitment. In that we must realize that Shukhevych, while correct about the criticality of peasants forming the backbone of struggle, is not appreciating their other, less desirable qualities.\n\nWe must have men who will not be easily confused or led astray, and in that we must accept that recruitment must be concentrated among men who can enforce Bandera's teachings. In this we will have dedicated soldiers, and no issues of morale."
 BOV_return_roots_desc: "Across all of Europe, who could understand subjugation better than a Ukrainian? A Ukrainian farmer. Across all our history, from the enslavement of the vile Russians, to the authoritarian centralizations of the Soviets, few have been beaten worse than the humble, average farmer. They are the basis of Ukrainian culture, the very concrete of our state, and they seem to know it.\n\nAcross Western Ukraine, rural farming slaves have escaled, and banded together to form militias in light of the growing anarchy across Ukraine. With some persuasion, it seems all too possible that these farmers' militias can be drawn into our great alliance, and we can fight for our freedom- together. Farmer and soldier, together. Only then can we ensure Ukraine is free."
 BOV_thunder_mountains_desc: "The Carpathians are a wonderful place for anyone to disappear, be that for a journey of self-discovery, for crimes, or just as likely for a struggle against foreign oppressors. We of course made good and strong use of these mountains during our First Struggle against the Poles, the Moskals, and the Germans. We would attack where they expected least, then quickly disappear into the mountains; by the time they noticed something was off, we were hidden away, heavy equipment and all. Of course, this means that the recent reports that our men have managed to find old artillery from the First Struggle hidden away in those mountains are no surprise to us. Let us direct the men to pull these guns out of their various hidey-holes; it will afford us some good firepower."
 BOV_born_great_hour_desc: "The Reichskommissariat—that abomination of the German bastards, built to oppress good Ukrainian sons—is at last collapsing under the weakness of the feckless Koch and his degenerate ministers. It is clear, now, with the news of the old son of a whore in Germania dying, that no better opportunity exists for us to liberate great Ukraine.\n\nWe were born in a great hour: an hour of valiant resistance and combat for the freedom of Ukraine. Though we met with defeat time and again at the hands of the Moskals, the Germans, and the Poles, we bled them white and remained able to fight every time they thought they had won. We are the warriors born to free our beloved Ukraine. Under the Vozhd, we are certain to obtain victory—to purify and liberate the Ukrainian state!\n\nO Bandera, our father and liberator, look upon our fight with pride! By God we swear that Ukraine shall be free once more and built in the way you envisioned!"

 BOV_third_final_struggle_desc: "The end has begun. All that is left to be decided is whether we win, or we die. Blood shall be spilt in honor of Bandera's legacy, either as victors, or martyrs. No matter the cost, no matter the opponent, we have the will to fight for Ukraine. For Bandera. For all Ukrainians persecuted, killed, raped, mutilated, treated as dirt. Our struggle for freedom is coming to an end, one drenched in blood.\n\nSlava Ukraini!"
 BOV_empower_peasantry_desc: "Many years spent in the shadows, pursued by the most efficient and ruthless of killers, has made us well understand the danger of arming those who you do not trust. So it is with the national peasantry. Far too many are, or were, collaborators. Or worse.\n\nYet, we have no choice. We must have men to fill out the ranks, to fill out the line, or we shall be overrun. They will be recruited and given nominal training. Perhaps some will discover their heroism. For those who prove themselves unreliable, well, there are far more direct solutions."
 BOV_demons_thicket_desc: "While it cannot be denied that we are in desperate need of manpower, in desperate need of armed formations of any kind, we cannot allow that need to drive us into potentially catastrophic mistakes. We do not have that luxury. So it is with the question of arming the peasantry.\n\nWhile it is true that to do so would give us a much-needed influx of militiamen, we cannot be assured of their loyalty on a national scale, and so they will remain in their local defense areas. Our trained fighters might be spread increasingly thin, but at least they will be reliable."
 BOV_rivne_heart_desc: "For many years, Rivne functioned as the black heart of the German administration, and while we may hate what it represented, we cannot afford to ignore a resource. For the old tractor factory complexes there still operate, and they present a tremendous opportunity for us if turned to the war effort.\n\nRepurposed vehicles, converted from tractors to technicals, would give us a significant advantage in the battles to come, especially against other irregular forces. It will not be without cost, but the rewards cannot be denied."
 BOV_galicia_veins_desc: "Under the invaders, Galicia was turned into a marvel of decentralized industry. Small workshops, artisanal factories, and production facilities dot the landscape - decadent constructions that would disgust any true Ukrainian. Yet, we cannot afford to ignore this resource in such dire times.\n\nWhat can be repurposed for military production will be, after expropriation. Whatever cannot be sold on, and the windfall reinvested into the struggle. Galicia's industry will serve the cause, one way or the other."
 BOV_oaken_ramparts_desc: "The UNRA is pressing us hard, indeed. Fortunately for us, however, most of the frontage in their areas is in harsh terrain, especially woodlands. Long experience hiding in those same forests has made our men something of an expert in their use - and exploitation.\n\nThese skills can be put to use, rapidly and ingeniously fortifying those forested areas against the Guard. Every defensive line created strengthens our position and releases some of the pressure on precious manpower. We must encourage such labor with all haste."
 BOV_define_innocence_desc: "What separates a guilty man from an innocent one in Ukraine? The innocent man holds the injustices committed against our nation close to his heart, never once allowing his mind to wander into feelings of compromise or reconciliation. He is steadfast in prosecuting the enemies of the people, staying his hand only when the last enemy of Ukraine lies dead at his feet. The guilty man, meanwhile, hardly requires introduction. He is an opportunist; a snake who sells out his countrymen out of cowardice, indifference, or even malice.\n\nSadly, there are some amongst the ranks of the UPA who have begun to see the guilty in a different light: sympathizing with the view that a select few of those who collaborated with Germany are not beyond salvation. This is a childish, fantastical notion at best, and we must root it out before it has time to blossom. Treason is treason, after all, and the guilty will be punished without hesitation or remorse."
 BOV_cauldrons_steel_desc: "Our forces fight valiantly, and it is agreed by all that the Republicans cannot, will not, and shall not breach our lines - anywhere. But if they somehow do, if the unthinkable were to come to pass, we must be ready. We must be prepared.\n\nIn such a case, our last bastions will be in the cities, and we shall make them cauldrons of steel, extracting barrels of blood for each step taken inside them. Every vehicle and building will be made a strongpoint, and they will be bled white, street by street."
 BOV_perdition_guilty_desc: "The traitors who once lorded over their own kinsmen like slave drivers now rot in musty, crowded cells awaiting the day of retribution. These worms are bastards to a man, each and every one condemned for putting their own interests, as well as the interests of foreign invaders, ahead of Ukraine's: a heinous crime that can only be washed away with blood.\n\nSome of them beg for clemency, offering their services to the cause and singing hollow songs of their allegiance to the nation. It is, after all, only in their nature to yield meekly to their captors! Whatever skills these scum may possess are but a drop in the ocean compared to the depth of their sins. Public executions have been arranged in every city that currently lies under UPA control, to demonstrate to all the heavy price of turning your back on your countrymen."
 BOV_second_struggle_avenged_desc: "After a hard-fought campaign in the western fringes of Ukraine, the so-called UNRA lies vanquished before us. Their feeble republican movement has been scattered to the wind, marking a new chapter in the quest for a free and independent Ukraine: one shaped by patriotic Banderite thought rather than the milquetoast republicanism espoused by the Guard and their puppeteers. All that remains is to march to the aid of our brethren to the East, who still languish under the rule of tyrants. The final step to unification is at hand, and the destiny of Ukraine hangs in the balance. The struggle shall not end until victory is ours, no matter how many must give their lives in the name of liberation!"
 BOV_nourishing_bodies_desc: "Ukraine was once one of the most fertile lands in all of Eurasia, her endless fields of grain serving as the breadbasket for nations the world over. Those days, regretfully, are long over. Sucked dry by the Soviet and Nazi machines, and scorched away by the war that now ravages our homeland, the people of Ukraine have been left with very little to keep their bellies full. While our own forces too are struggling to find sustenance each day, it would be a severe dereliction of our duties to Ukraine to let the people starve. Our already meager rations will be cut even further to provide some relief, fleeting as it may be, to the people. Let this act of kindness serve as another reminder of the UPA's benevolence, and its commitment to Ukraine's wellbeing!"
 BOV_enriching_minds_desc: "For most, the UPA's ultimate objectives are simple enough to understand. We seek only the total liberation of Ukraine from foreign oppressors and traitors alike, and to avenge the decades of injustices inflicted upon her people. There are those, however, who doubt our sincerity, whose minds have been clouded by a vast web of lies spun by our many enemies.\n\nMurderers! Rapists! Barbarians! All of these hyperbolic words and more are used to decry our just cause, and if action is not taken, the people may begin to be seduced by these slanderous accusations. An education program shall be started to espouse the virtues of the UPA and make our countrymen understand that we come as liberators, not conquerors. Victory may only be achieved when the hearts of the nation beat as one, and when everyone from the highest-ranking general to the lowliest peasant is able to stand in common cause."
 BOV_swell_ironworks_desc: "As we have retaken more of Ukraine, we have also retaken resources and industrial potential, and restored some of the supply and input lines cut in the conflict's outbreak. This does not, however, mean that they are immediately operational again, and it will take work to restore dormant factories to operation.\n\nWork that will, shall, be carried out. The fight is not yet over, and we must have more war material to support the fronts that are still active. It will benefit all to see these great foundries once again operational."
 BOV_industrial_battalions_desc: "Years of occupation and collaborator 'schooling' has, unfortunately, left few of our countrymen with anything that could be considered technical skills. We must therefore find ways to remedy this if we are to expand our expert workforce, and a proposal has been received.\n\nThose few engineers we do have will be given officer ranks and positioned in command of workers battalions, tasked with skills transfer. It will be an agonizingly slow process, yes, but it will, in time, serve to grow our technical workforce."
 BOV_rebuild_plast_desc: "In days long gone, the Plast was the crucible in which many of the UPA's current general staff were forged. It was once a scouting organization for young students, intended to teach them in the ways of wilderness survival and crucial leadership skills. This organization provided a plethora of talented officers for the UPA, and if we wish to lay the seeds for the next generation, a new Plast will be needed.\n\nWith the scout troops revived, the youth of Ukraine will be reinvigorated with patriotic ideals, learning from a young age to put their fatherland ahead of all else. It is in the newly restored Plast where the idea of the new Ukrainian warrior will be born: fiercely devoted to the defense of his country, tempered with a deep care for the wellbeing of his countrymen. Coupled with the skills needed to lead their brethren to victory even in the hardiest of circumstances, they will make for a fine body of soldiers indeed!"
 BOV_banderite_virtue_desc: "Many have pushed for us to send every man - regardless of age - to the front, in order to push for victory. But we resistrealize the folly of this, for there is no victory to be had if our next generation is destroyed in achieving it, and sending teenagers to the battlefield would only guarantee such an outcome.\n\nThey can, instead, be far better utilized through their education in Bandera's tenets. They can act as loyal sentries in their community, reporting on and protecting against ethical decay, acting as role models for younger children, and more."
 BOV_souls_slag_desc: "It cannot be denied that we have an excess of brave patriots willing to fight - and die - for the dream that is Ukraine. Yet, we do not have an excess of weaponry, and a man with no weapon is worse than useless on the battlefield. The same cannot be said of the foundry.\n\nMany factories remain severely understaffed as a result of accidents and dangerous conditions, and these men can serve there. Surely they will brave the slag if doing so helps secure victory."
 BOV_every_soldier_desc: "In our existential struggle, there is no resource, no man, that can sit unused. All must serve - in one way or another - if Ukraine is to be free. There can be no exceptions. Such is the case with our division of manpower between the front and the factories.\n\nThere are those who may think they possess exemptions from the factory, and this may be true. But they have no exemptions from the fight, and clearly if they can be spared from the assembly line, they can, will, and shall contribute to the front line. The fight demands it."
 BOV_ukrainian_purity_desc: "Who can deny that it is we - us - who are the only ones acting with conviction to protect Ukraine from the menaces that circle it? That we are the only ones protecting the traditions of old, and the only ones who can properly build a future? None who speak the truth, surely.\n\nWe are Ukraine, and Ukraine is us, and this has never been more true than it is now, with enemies circling around who would see our people and our culture erased from existence. Anyone who so denies is clearly an enemy to be fought - and we will do so with conviction."
 BOV_reverse_shackles_desc: "As the conflict subsides, the rats naturally try to flee, and the German settlers imposed on our lands are no different. They, however, have not been as successful as they desperately hoped, and many have been captured by our forces. They must answer for the crimes of their beloved Reich.\n\nSo they shall. The debt owed can, of course, never fully be repaid - but a start can be had. They can take the place of the slaves they so cruelly exploited for so long, and so contribute to the continuing war effort. We will see how long they last."
 BOV_reclaim_crimea_desc: "After countless battles, and years of struggle, finally we stand on the precipice of victory. The communists have been decapitated, dispersed, and driven into the forests and wilds, unable to mount attacks. The Germans and their collaborators have been almost entirely vanquished. But the fight is not yet over.\n\nCrimea still stands as an odious bastion of German influence, and this cannot stand. We will push forward, and drown the Teutonic scourge in the sea!"
 BOV_bandera_triumphant_desc: "For the first time in many, many, many years, Ukraine is free. Of communists. Of Germans. Of all those who would see it shackled, oppressed, and trampled underfoot. Ukraine stands triumphant over its foes, and stands even stronger as a free nation for the Ukrainian people.\n\nThis victory was near-eternity in the making, and though Bandera is not here to see it, surely he smiles down from the heavens upon us, and upon the fulfillment of our, and his, lifelong dream.\n\nSlava Ukraini!"
 BOV_decapitated_azhdaya_desc: "What is going on?\n\nCommunications have been suddenly and totally lost with cities and military units across Ukraine, from north to south and east to west. Nothing is working - radios, telephones, even messengers - and we exist in a near-total information blackout.\n\nNo -one that we can talk to, be they politician, military officer, civilian, or anything else, has any answers, and cannot even begin to decide upon a course of action.\n\nWhat are we to do now?"

 BOV_deluge_deceit_desc: "We have been betrayed. Roman Shukhevcyh and Yaroslav Stetsko, both former Banderites, have defected to the Melnykites, exposing systemic disloyalty to the UPA, and the legacy of Stepan Bandera, who shaped this nation. Where else could there be disloyalty? The Sluzha Bezpeky? The very administration? Now, we can't trust anyone.\n\nMoving forward, we must be vigilant; it is crucial that no more defectors arise. To do this, we must thoroughly and diligently purge all disloyalty from the country. We will be vulnerable to the opposition, who will almost definitely attempt to overthrow us in our moment of weakness. This is the greatest challenge the UPA will ever face. If we prevail, our revolution will live on. Should we not, the dream of a Greater Ukraine will be extinguished."
 BOV_gut_sb_desc: "The Sluzhba Bezpeky, our secret police force, has done its part in securing the destiny of our revolution. However, in light of recent events that occurred in the UPA, we have to make some intensive changes to how it is run, and who runs it.\n\nThe SB was run by Mykola Lebed, a lapdog of Stetsko. The SB, having been run by Lebed with no oversight, has left it compromised. These two facts create an extremely concerning issue, something that can be consequential if it isn't fixed immediately."
 BOV_emergency_restructuring_desc: "There is systemic disloyalty everywhere in our government. The administration is no exception, according to our secret police. The Sluzhba Bezpeky is aware of the administrators who need to go.\n\nThe SB will round up the administrators, interrogate them, relieve them of their duties, and dispose of them. The Vozhd is prepared for this and has handpicked new administrators to replace them. Our government requires honest, loyal, and diligent administrators to function. Should our administrators not meet those requirements, they will have to be excised."
 BOV_autumn_anarchy_desc: "As predicted, the Communists and Melnykites noticed our reorganization. Like ravens on a corpse, they have once again revolted, hoping to topple our regime. Although they don't know it, they are gravely mistaken. Our revolution is not a corpse. It is alive and thriving; we shall crush them, quickly and decisively.\n\nHowever, we must act fast. These savages are ravaging the countryside, attempting to rally the people against us. To succeed, we must match their rampage with one of our own."
 BOV_peasant_pawns_desc: "The King and the Peasant. In feudal times, the King ruled and protected the peasants who worked for him. While Europe moved past this relationship, the Russians didn't. Under their incompetent rule, Russia lagged behind the rest of Europe. Now, we must modernize the relationship between the State and the Peasant.\n\nThese peasants are very conservative, and most would enthusiastically join our ranks against the Melnykites and the Bolsheviks. Should we use the peasants against them, they will help our cause. In this grand game of Chess, the peasants are nothing but our pawns."
 BOV_polish_scourge_desc: "For centuries, the Polish have oppressed the Ukrainian people. After the Polish-Soviet War, they seized western Galicia, rightful Ukrainian territory, from us. To the present day, they still own it, briefly interrupted by the invasion of Poland.\n\nSimilarly to us, the Poles only just got independence from the Germans. They are still weak. If we plan well and strike fast, we may continue our quest; to create a Greater Ukraine."
 BOV_roaches_rats_desc: "There were many German collaborators. They are rats, scum of the earth. Although the Vozhd and Bandera collaborated with the Nazis, they viewed it as an alliance. When the Nazis attempted to assert authority, they broke their pact with the Nazis. However, those who continue to collaborate with the Nazis are rats.\n\nHowever, some don't like the Nazis. Yet, they collaborate, fearing for their lives. These are the cockroaches, and we can easily filter them out from the rats. These roaches can be very useful to us; they have valuable experience and can be easily beaten into compliance."
 BOV_shumskyi_white_desc: "Throughout recent history, the Communists persevered, even when defeat seemed imminent. Lenin never gave up on his revolution, and eventually, they overthrew the Russian Empire. Bukharin never gave up on the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa. However, for Bukharin, the outcome was quite different. Yet, the Communists will continue to live on, and one spark of hope could lead to a fire of resistance.\n\nTo prevent this, we must act quickly and decisively. We must strike, again, again, and again. If we give the Communists time to lick their wounds, we will be putting our government at risk. No matter the cost, no Communists shall gain an inch of land in Ukraine!"
 BOV_galvanize_galicians_desc: "To continue preparations for our annexation of Galicia, we must send a message to our Galician brothers. Right now, they are under Polish oppression. Soon we will liberate them, and we must establish contacts there. Perhaps they can assist us in our cause. Our success relies on the cooperation of our countrymen to resist the subcultural Polish swine."
 BOV_melnyk_vermin_desc: "After painstaking efforts from what remains of the Sluzhba Bezpeky, we have tracked down the remnants of the militant Melnykite movement, which is in Chernihiv. The faction is nothing but a shadow of its former self, now under Roman Sushko.\n\nOnce we purge the remnants of the Melnykites, we will destroy all factionalism in the OUN; once more, we will unite the OUN as one party, an occasion which merits a 'Slava Ukraini!'"
 BOV_op_golov_desc: "After meticulous planning by our officers and the Vozhd, it's ready. Operation Golovinsky, our operation to liberate Galicia, has been extensively planned. Now, the only thing separating us and reunification with our countrymen is the simple go-ahead of an order from the supreme Vozhd and Poland shall once again know our fury!"

 BOV_last_roman_desc: "On many occasions the Romans of old were rent asunder by civil war, and only by the victory of one claimant was some form of order recovered. So it is today, with Shukhevych standing atop the remains of a once-unified front, and the pillars of Klyachkivsky and Stetsko torn down.\n\nThe reins of Ukraine, of the future of the state and its people, are in his hands - and he will have to act quickly to solidify his hold. For Ukraine - and for the promises of prosperity that seem so far away."
 BOV_shattered_front_desc: "It was taken for granted that the unity once achieved by Bandera would endure among all Ukrainians. That fantasy has been shattered - at staggering cost to the people as a whole. Different militias, movements, and individuals fought each other as much as they did the invaders, and so consigned all to decline.\n\nThis must be corrected. The effort required will be truly enormous, but the rifts between these groupings must be mended and a common front established. We are all, first and foremost, whatever our differences, Ukrainian."
 BOV_insuring_insurgencies_desc: "Regardless of overtures made, the Communists and Republicans continue to fight expecting, as has happened many times in the past, their families to suffer the consequences if they are betrayed. We have no such intention, but we cannot blame them - the scars run deep.\n\nThey will not yet join us, but this does not mean we need be punitive. We can fight them as honorably as possible, treat their prisoners with respect, and peacefully occupy the lands we take from them - absent reprisals. In time, they will learn our sincerity, and join us as brothers."
 BOV_line_in_sand_desc: "No matter what we do or say, the Communists and Republicans fight on, wasting lives, effort, and resources against fellow Ukrainians instead of against those who wish us all erased. We must put a stop to this, and if we cannot outright defeat them in the field, we can at least make a deal.\n\nWe shall pledge to eschew any reprisal action against them or their families as long as they refrain from attacks on or destruction of critical infrastructure. It will be a suspicious truce, to be sure, but it will serve our needs for now - and that must be good enough."
 BOV_uneasy_truce_desc: "Though there are still skirmishes between our forces and those of our common ideological foes, they have declined in recent times owing, at least in part, to the repeated overtures of peace that have been extended by our leadership. Cautious questions have been sent to us in reply, and while it is obvious that they are using this lull to recover from the wounds we have inflicted upon them, it is at least a peace, of sorts.\n\nOnly time will tell if this 'peace' will truly last, but if we make the effort to preserve it, perhaps in time a true understanding can be reached."
 BOV_ukrainian_triumvirate_desc: "Without a doubt one of the most damaging decisions of Klyachkivsky was the over-centralization of power in only one man's hands - his own. It turned him into a tyrant, repressing any dissent, and the results were disastrous for all. We will not repeat this mistake.\n\nExecutive power will be invested in a council, and though Shukhevych will necessarily retain its chairmanship, he will not be a dictator. Checked and informed by fellow patriots, the worst excesses will be avoided, and consensus will be obtained before decisions."
 BOV_excise_excess_desc: "Shukhevych's legacy as a former collaborator is a somewhat messy one, but one more than exonerated of through his actions. Many followed with him, even before the Ukrainian Civil War, but it's no well-hidden secret that those who fled with him during and after the Civil War were certainly not well-meaning, and were only looking out for their own hides. These collaborator scum must be purged from our ranks, and doing so will come with great ease.\n\nWhile treasonous shrews like Stetsko will inevitably protest, they have hardly any say in this matter, and that point besides, their complaints will only make it easier to track down these backstabbing elements. Ukraine has no place for traitors and the criminally evil, and the former employees of Nazis are no exception."
 BOV_fractured_organization_desc: "The void of charisma and unifying presence left by the death of Konovalets has left the OUN as a bickering, infighting - often literally - mess ever since, and Shukhevych's triumph has not resolved this. Every day, disparate factions bite at each other like rabid dogs in the halls of the government, impeding operations; if we hope for our organization to stand the test of time, or even five years, this must be eliminated.\n\nNothing generates unity like justice, and, fortunately, now provides an excellent opportunity. With the defeat of the Reichskommissariat, we have an abundance trials of traitors and oppressors to be put on trial, to receive due retribution for lifetimes and lives lost, bringing true justice for the past to Ukraine.\n\nThis is far from the beginning of our efforts on unifying the OUN, and far from the beginning of a unified OUN, but even still, we must begin, or all will be lost."
 BOV_humiliate_honorless_desc: "A bureaucratic system is a spine that keeps any nation floating, so it is deeply ironic that our bureaucracy is filled with those who have none whatsoever. Leftovers from the accursed Reichskommissariat, most of the current basis of our government consists of former collaborators who managed to escape the rope during initial trials of the collaborators; most pointing to their past incompetences as proof of resistance, which they may as well have been. While this cannot be allowed to persist, we regretfully cannot outright cleanse ourselves of most of our bean-counting office workers. As a result, the solution is obvious.\n\nTo eliminate the highest ranking survivors of the purges will ensure that examples are made publicly, while parading around the rest as those who sold out their country and must be fixed to love it as they once did will allow us to ensure they are sufficiently dedicated to the cause once more. They simply do not yet know they have it in them."
 BOV_subdue_surpents_desc: "Many of those former collaborators who aided in the liberation from before the start have been exceptionally dedicated to the cause, though some were limited to collaboration as it was the only way forward for a Ukrainian state. Not their leaders, however. Those leaders who did everything to collaborate above promoting nationalism do not deserve the beat of their hearts or the breath in their lungs. Depriving them of both will prove the only way forward for Ukraine.\n\nExecuting Stsiborskyi, Stetsko, and Shandruk immediately will prove itself the greatest boon to Ukrainian nationalism since Taras Shevchenko's first writings. They will not be missed. In their absence, Ukraine will prosper, the nation will grow stronger, and political divisiveness will fade into the past. May their graves be forgotten, and the unity of the OUN stand forevermore."
 BOV_emboldening_embers_desc: "Many former collaborators were left with no choice but to follow the Melnykites to express their nationalism, but the most righteous path has revealed itself, and all were given the choice to follow it, and so they have.\n\nReunifying the OUN has come as no easy feat, but to solidify these gains we must make efforts to appeal to their total support. No organization such as ours can fully function without total cooperation, and we are certain these initially more avid collaborators will be able to offer such - or will prove themselves useful in other ways. The OUN now stands taller than ever, perhaps even now rivalling the age of Konovalets, and we could never be prouder of it."
 BOV_score_unsettled_desc: "Galicia has always been Ukrainian, no matter the endless Polish ethnic cleansing efforts since the tragedy of their war with the Russians in the '20s. Ever since, the Piedmont of Ukraine has remained seperate from its nation, and regardless of whatever throwaway promises the Germans made to the Melnykite traitors they saw no reason to change this situation. As such, with the overthrow of the Generalgouvernment, the Poles still hold half of Ukraine, and our homes, families, and people still rest under their thumb. It is high time we bring Galicia home.\n\nThe Poles will obviously not be grateful for the deal we are offering them, but for all their oppressions of our people in the past, it is more than generous enough.\n\nThe Poles will return our rightful lands.\n\n§ROr their blood will water our land before we return.§!"

 BOV_fortune_infamous_desc: "At every level, and at every obstacle that the Vozhd faced, people said that he could not overcome them. 'Stetsko will fail this time' was a thought widely shared. But he never did - and never will. The actions taken to secure ultimate power have inspired rage, hatred, and plotting against him, but he will solve all of these, in time.\n\nThe odds have always been against him, both internally and externally, and yet fortune's favor cannot be denied. The Vozhd will endure this trial as well. As he always has."
 BOV_yaroslav_wisdom_desc: "Whereas others in Ukraine focus on the immediate, Stetsko looks beyond. Towards history, both past and future. Emulating Yaroslav the Wise, he sees the larger picture and how, regardless of recent events, the real enemy of millenia past are the Russo-Mongolian hordes.\n\nGermany, for all its many failings, won a great victory against them for the Aryan race and for the European peoples, and this cannot be understated. Taking this wisdom, Stetsko will carefully guide the ship of state, and bring Ukraine to stand as an equal with its contemporaries."
 BOV_twist_dagger_desc: "The mighty Vozhd was forced to make unfortunate deals and compromises to seize our independent state's reigns. The underhanded and covert nature of these efforts has seen disgruntled voices in our movement make startling comparisons between our Vozhd and the Jewish parasites that defiled our homeland. This is unacceptable! The wise Stestko represents a new future for the Aryans of Ukraine, and like a true Aryan, he shall triumph over all who question his reign."
 BOV_streets_rage_desc: "Even after all that our nation has been through, marching through blood, sweat, and tears from decades of warfare with Bolshevism and traitors, our country remains polluted. The Slavic-Mongol bands of Poles and Russians, now free of their imprisonments, scour the countryside in roving bands, causing disorder and terror. Enough is enough; we shall remind these scum of their place in Ukraine, even if we have to commit some terrors of our own!"
 BOV_reassure_settlers_desc: "Since the end of the Reichskommissariat and our force's triumph in the civil war, our Aryan brethren amongst the settlers have watched us with a growing sense of dread and paranoia, doubtlessly beset by fear of treasonous psychopaths like Klyachkivsky. Fear not, beloved cousins! We are not madmen, traitors, or degenerates, but fellow Aryans and model Ukrainians, and there is nothing to fear..."
 BOV_media_blackout_desc: "The Jews that control the media within America and its decadent vessels have smelt blood. The troubles within Germany have given them newfound motivation to sneak their degenerate values into the minds of anyone no longer shielded by German censors. Ukrainians are unfortunately no exception.\n\nIn order to prevent the degradation of our values caused by this onslaught of Jewish propaganda, Ukraine must double its censorship efforts and flood the airwaves to counter any and all liberal and communist influence. If our newfound state is to survive for any time, our people's minds must be free of any corruptive influence."
 BOV_our_bloodlands_await_desc: "Galicia is Ukrainian - It always has been, and it always will be. Whether it was ruled by Poles, Austrians, Russians or Poles again did not change this fact. Those Poles who still occupy Galicia may try to deny this and deny us our homes. If they do not relinquish territory, we will have to remind them of our legitimate claim.\n\nThe Germans seem somewhat convinced of our right to Galicia, giving Ukrainians autonomy within the Polish Administration. In addition, both Bandera and Shukhevych have made efforts in the past to cleanse the land. It could take only one final push to see Galicia populated wholly by Ukranains and to see no Pole or any other race haunt these lands again."

 #civil war events
 
 BOV.1.t: "Chaos in the Streets"
 BOV.1.d: "The poster was full of hope. Filled dreams of liberation from the Nazi order. Filled with dreams of a strong, free future. The poster depicted the Brotherhood, Klyachkivsky, the Citizenry, and the Soldiers each grabbing an arm of the swastika and ripping it into quarters, with the message "Our Right to be Free" in the center. But Roman was skeptical. How could the Brotherhood free Ukraine from the Nazis when it cannot even save its own streets from chaos?\n\nEvery day, there was a riot, a bombing, or a lynching in the streets. Going out to do an errand without some sort of protection was a guaranteed way to get brutally beaten and robbed of all possessions. The streets were anarchic, and the Brotherhood was doing nothing to fix the situation. Instead, the men sat in their high castle, ordering civilians to die pointless deaths for their vile cause. They rode out on the street in armored trucks, capturing minorities like Jews and Poles, to lynch them with the rest of the mobs. Roman's face contorted in disgust.\n\nSuddenly, the poster became a source of pain to Roman, as if looking at it set a torch directly to his soul. He grasped the poster and tore it down from the wall in a moment of uncontrolled hatred and anger. He breathed heavily. Then, Roman quickly walked away, knowing that if a loyalist had seen what he did, he would be next on the Brotherhood's purge list."
 BOV.1.a: "The unconvinced in our land will soon be silenced."
 
 BOV.2.t: "The Farmer and the Brotherhood"
 BOV.2.d: "Petro Poltavets stared at the men in black uniforms trespassing on his farm. Even from 70 meters away, he could sense their malevolence rolling off of them in waves. As they approached, he felt an almost animalistic instinct telling him to turn back and flee, to save himself from whatever horrors the men in black were going to show him. But, if there was something Petro was known for, it was his courage, and so he held his ground and let the men approach him.\n\nAs the men got closer, one of them looked at the list in his hands.\n\n"Slava Ukraini! We are with the Brotherhood of Volyn. You are Petro Poltavets of the Poltavets Farmstead, correct?"\n\n"You would be right," Petro replied calmly, trying not to reveal the fear he felt. The Brotherhood of Volyn? They were extremist terrorists! What were they doing here?\n\n"Good. I am glad to inform you that you will now be fighting on the front lines for the liberation of Ukraine. You are expected to lay down your life for your motherland. Do I make myself clear?"\n\nPetro's eyes widened in disbelief. He was being conscripted to fight for terrorists!\n\n"Listen, you terrorist bastards, I will fight for Ukraine on my own terms! I will not be press-ganged into your-"\n\nHis sentence was cut short by the second man, who smashed the butt of his pistol over Petro's now-unconscious head. The man with the list looked at his comrade and said,\n\n"Grab him and put him in the truck.""
 BOV.2.a: ""He will soon know obedience to the Brotherhood well enough.""
 
 BOV.3.t: "Fallen Prayers"
 BOV.3.d: "The factory's innards were stinking, putrid, and hotter than Huttig's Afrika on a bright summer day. If only the workers could see the natural light outside, that is. The factory was its own closed microcosm of Hell, with the workers inside treated as nothing more than battered, overheated pieces of meat made to produce more guns, more tools, and more parts on a daily basis.\n\nMykhailo was one of those workers, sore, stinking, and desperate for food and water. His arms felt like they were going to fall off, and his lungs felt like they were going to collapse from the amount of heated fumes he was inhaling. But he could not stop, not even for a second, lest the guards see him. He kept fitting the firing pin into the receiver, firing pin into the receiver, firing pin into the receiver, over and over for at least 16 hours a day.\n\nBut Mykhailo could not scream, nor could he cry. He could only make guns for the damnable Brotherhood to help in their plans to ruin Ukraine. But there was something he could do, something not even the ever-vigilant Brotherhood guards could notice. He could silently pray. Pray for his survival, pray for Ukraine's well-being, and pray for the destruction of the Brotherhood and the Germans. But as the days dragged on, with the work hours longer and longer, Mykhailo feared his prayers had fallen on deaf ears."
 BOV.3.a: "For prayers alone could not destroy the Germans."

 BOV.4.t: "And the Women, Too"
 BOV.4.d: "Maryna stared at the gun in her hands for a long, long time. She had no idea how to use it, or how it worked. She had never even held a gun before this! She even told it to the Brotherhood recruiters, too! And yet they took her from her home anyway, a conscript about to be sent to the front lines to die fighting real soldiers. Jesus, Maryna thought, she was going to be fighting real soldiers with real combat experience, while her regiment was so underequipped that she didn't even have combat shoes! Maryna quaked with fear.This is it, she thought. This is where my story ends.\n\nMaryna ran a little farm, about thirty minutes from Zhytomyr. She had taken over control after her father and brothers all perished fighting the Germans in the second world war. She led a lonely but satisfactory life. She was lucky enough to not be enslaved by the Germans, and their presence in Ukraine did not meaningfully affect her life. This, of course, all changed when the men in black appeared at her doorstep, telling her about "Ukraine's glorious liberation," and how it was her duty to fight for it.\n\nNow, Maryna felt like she was going to die from fear before she ever had to fight a German. Before she ever had to fight a fellow Ukrainian. Maryna shuddered at the thought. She was going to be killing her own countrymen. Or be killed by them. She put down her rifle. She could not bear to keep it in her hands any longer. It would soon be picked up from her corpse by the enemy anyway."
 BOV.4.a: "All people, regardless of gender, must fight for Ukraine!"

 BOV.5.t: "Ash"
 BOV.5.d: "Yevhen's old bones and joints were sore from a combination of age, military service, and arthritis, but he still kept moving. He had to lead his grandchildren somewhere safe, somewhere far away from the Brotherhood of Volyn, and possibly even far away from Ukraine itself. He could still smell the ashes of his entire hometown after they were engulfed in flames. He could smell all of the seventy years of memories destroyed in the instant the blaze was lit. That night, and all of the nights since, he cried. Cried for the memories lost. Cried for the sanctuary he had built with his two hands being ruined as if it was nothing of any significance. Cried for the ashes of his wife being further desecrated by the ever hungry fire.\n\nHe recalled when they had given him the order to evacuate his house. A man dressed in uniform, Captain Voloshyn, gave him five minutes for him and his grandchildren to gather essential supplies before leaving. The Captain announced that they were burning the entire town down, and that Yevhen and his family would be forced out by gunpoint if they did not comply. And so Yevhen gave in. He wanted to put up a fight, to defend what was rightfully his, but he recognized the futility of it. So he told his grandchildren to gather everything they needed and nothing more, and they quickly fled the town. When Larysa and Pavlo asked him why they left, his mouth became dry. He could not bring himself to look his grandchildren in the eyes. He simply dragged them along with him.\n\nThe exhaustion of his joints and limbs quickly dragged Yevhen back to the present. He could run no further. He stopped Larysa and Pavlo, and they rested for the night. In the morning they would keep running. They could never get far enough away from their paradise lost."
 BOV.5.a: "Was it all necessary?"

 BOV.6.t: "A Night in the Warehouse"
 BOV.6.d: "Dmytro, Yuri, and Vasyl stared at the warehouse after a long day of walking to Kyiv. They had ducked and weaved past countless German patrols and through waves upon waves of artillery fire, and yet they felt intimidated by a warehouse. Vasyl took a second to scope out as many possible entrances to the warehouse as he could find. No windows. Of course.\n\nVasyl sighed heavily. "God damn, no windows. Looks like we're headed straight through the front door."\n\n"What? Are you nuts, Vasyl? That's gonna get us all killed!"\n\n"Shit, Yuri, quiet down! Vasyl's right. It's the only way into the warehouse. Besides, it's probably unguarded anyway. You remember how many German soldiers we sneaked past? We probably went past their entire army! We'll be fine," Dmytro replied. "We get in, we blow it up, we get out. It's a 20 minute mission."\n\nYuri steeled himself. He couldn't be a coward, not when they already made it this far!\n\n"Right, right. You're right. We can do this. The end is right here, for God's sake! Come on, let's get this over with."\n\nVasyl stepped up first and grabbed the door handle. He turned it, pushed on the door... and nothing. No hurried words in that disgusting language, German. No German rats standing there, ready to be slaughtered like sheep. Nothing.\n\nVasyl looked back. "It's clear! Let's get this done and over with."\n\nThirty minutes later, a blinding flash alerted the Germans that something was terribly wrong at their warehouse. By the time they got there, however, it was already too late."
 BOV.6.a: "Another successful mission pulled off by our brave operatives!"
 
 BOV.7.t: "The Railroad"
 BOV.7.d: "Hrihoriy clutched the explosives in his hand tightly, as if they would suddenly jump out and run away into the distant horizon. He suppressed a yawn, careful to not alert any more Germans that could be nearby. While he had already slit the throats of all of the Germans he found at the railroad, he could never be too careful on missions like this. This particular railroad was an important supply junction, connected to all of the cities in the surrounding area, which were all heavily fortified front-line towns. It was all the more important that Hrihoriy completed his mission successfully.\n\nHrihoriy crouched, moving silently towards his target, vigilantly watching for any enemy troops that happened to stumble by. He dropped down quickly onto the railroad and began to lay the explosives. After he was done laying the sixth explosive device, he heard a sound that made his heart sink into his stomach.\n\nHe heard a wild and panicked German voice, presumably crying out for any comrades he could find. Suddenly, he heard shots from the German luger whizzing past his head, and Hrihoriy bolted away from the railway junction. He heard more German voices coming around, and he knew what he had to do. His objective. He whipped the detonator out from his pocket, and pressed the button. A deafening BOOM echoed for miles and miles, most definitely alerting everyone in the area. And so Hrihoriy kept running, satisfied in the knowledge that even if he were caught and killed, he'd done some major damage to the enemy's supply lines. He grinned."
 BOV.7.a: "A devastating blow to the enemy's supplies!"

 BOV.8.t: "Order 439"
 BOV.8.d: "[ROOT.Capital.GetName], Order Number 439, issued [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong].\n\nThe war of liberation against the traitors of the UNRA, the Bolsheviks of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, and the tyrants of the Reichskommissariat and the Volksdirektorat has gone for far too long to the Brotherhood's dismay. Reports have shown that fighting still continues on all fronts, with no end in sight. Fighting ranges from large-scale front operations against the Wehrmacht, to small skirmishes within the countryside against disorganized enemy forces. Reports have also shown that the national stockpile of food and ammunition for the soldiers are slowly running out at an alarming rate.\n\nThe citizens of Ukraine, who have shown considerable support for the fighters and willingness to sacrifice for the Brotherhood, have also started to doubt if our cause was really worth their struggle and effort.\n\nTherefore, every man, woman, and even child, if they are of sufficient health and soundness, both mentally and physically, are to fight for Ukraine with their lives. Commanders and Generals are encouraged and obliged to send the men into the front in droves for a final offensive against enemy forces. When tactics are of no use, the soldiers will charge forwards without care for their lives, only caring for the liberation of Ukraine. Those that disobey orders, execute them at will for the crime of deserting from the army.\n\nAny sign of weakness is to be eliminated from the ranks. We have to be ready to give everything for Ukraine.\n\nFor the goal of liberation, we shall now adopt the slogan..."
 BOV.8.a: "Forwards, into the crossfire, forwards!"

UPA_CivilWar.1.t: "Sparks of the National Revolution"
UPA_CivilWar.1.d: "Klyachkivsky stood on the makeshift podium, a crowd surrounding him. He felt a pang of disappointment as so few people were there to witness him. Still, this speech isn't just for those who stand with him now; it is for all of Ukraine and with the scavenged recording equipment hastily assembled before him. It would be one that would resonate for decades to come.\n\n"I come before you today to speak of the great struggle ahead. For too long, our beloved Ukraine has been under the oppressive rule of the Nazi invaders. But thanks to the valiant efforts of the UPA, we have finally been able to shake off their shackles and begin the reclamation of our nation.\n\nBut make no mistake, our fight is far from over. The Germans, weakened though they may be, still threaten our continued freedom and independence. The liberals and communists - those who fostered the weakness and depravity that caused our nation to fall, still have gripped the minds of many of our countrymen. And so, we must prepare ourselves for the next stage of this war - a war of attrition, a war of survival.\n\nWe must summon all our strength and courage and draw upon the great spirit of our people. For we are of a superior stock, descended from the great warriors and heroes of our past. We have the will and the determination to overcome any obstacle that stands in our way.\n\nAnd we must be ready to face our foes once more, take back what is rightfully ours, and crush their futile attempts at resistance. We must show them that we are not to be underestimated and that their threats or weapons will not scare us. We must be united in this fight, for it is only through our unity that we can hope to emerge victorious. So let us stand together, brothers, and show the world what it means to be Ukrainian."
UPA_CivilWar.1.a: ""Glory to Ukraine, Glory to the UPA!""

UPA_CivilWar.2.t: "On Your Toes"
UPA_CivilWar.2.d: "Emerging from the forests, a group of UNRA soldiers had scouted a small village. Seemingly empty of any partisan activity, they cautiously crossed the perimeter. Their weapons are still at the ready. The streets were eerily quiet, and they couldn't help but let their guard down.\n\nA mistake that would cost them dearly.\n\nAs they entered the town square, a car bomb exploded, sending debris flying in every direction. One of the soldiers was killed instantly, and the rest were left stunned and disoriented.\n\nFrom the shadows, UPA partisans emerged, already firing. The UNRA soldiers fought back valiantly, but they were outnumbered and outmatched. One by one, they fell to the partisan's bullets.\n\nDead silence descended upon the town once again, as the lifeless bodies of the UNRA soldiers litter the streets."
UPA_CivilWar.2.a: "Returned to what it once was."

UPA_CivilWar.3.t: "The Cost of Freedom"
UPA_CivilWar.3.d: "Anton found himself knelt on the forest floor, his hands tied behind his back and his eyes closed - Surrounded by several UPA partisans, all pointing their guns at him. He can hear the sound of the wind rustling through the trees and the distant noises of the nearby city.\n\nOne of the captors steps forward, his face twisted into a perverted smile. He raised his gun and pointed it directly at the man's head. Anton opens his eyes and looks up at him, his expression calm and unafraid.\n\n"Any last words?" the captor snarls.\n\nAnton didn't say anything. Instead, he just leant forward as if he was to embrace his end. The captor hesitates for a moment, confused and concerned. He thinks the man is trying to attack him, and he panics.\n\nThe other captors followed suit, firing their guns randomly at the man. The bullets tear through his body, killing him instantly. It was a crude execution, one that did not match the strong orderly standards that those in the UPA aspired to, still - it was one less partisan all the same."
UPA_CivilWar.3.a: "And one more partisan they'd soon forget."

UPA_CivilWar.4.t: "To Kill a Hero"
UPA_CivilWar.4.d: "The head of the snake, leader of the UNRA, Yuriy Horlis, had finally fallen into the UPA's hands. His end would further fracture the liberal forces and cement the dominance of the Banderite movement over the nation.\n\nInto the forest they led him, and forced him onto the ground. The executioner looked into Yuriy's eyes, as he looked back - unshaken by his imminent doom. There was a mutual understanding between the two - Yuriy was too important to be treated as if he was worth a proper execution in front of a traumatized crowd. He would be a martyr, and his courage would humiliate the UPA.\n\nAnd so, in a quick, cold and calculated decision, Yuriy was shot before a word could be said. His body thrown into an unmarked grave, left to rot in the forest unnoticed."
UPA_CivilWar.4.a: "And so the legend ends, with a bang and a whimper."

UPA_CivilWar.5.t: "Remaking the Social Order"
UPA_CivilWar.5.d: "Every villager was packed into the town square. They had been summoned to hear a speech from a UPA official assigned to overlook the newly conquered town. Some in the crowd looked on in curiosity, others frightened or disinterested.\n\nThe man spoke of the insurgent army's power, its ability to bring strength and security to Ukrainians, Free from the boot of the Nazis, the tyranny of the communists and the disorder of the liberals. Many in the crowd, while forced to be there, took an interest in what the man was saying. He rambled on for some time. More and more of the crowd being hypnotized by his words.\n\nNothing of what he said seemed particularly controversial, and it felt natural as the man eventually started ranting about the "superiority of Ukrainian blood" and the need to rid the country of "inferior" elements.\n\nSome townsfolk exchanged worried glances, while others continued to watch. As the speech continued, the UPA leader called for a show of solidarity, and the crowd began to chant "Slava Ukraini!" in unison. Some looked on in horror as friends and neighbors embraced the rhetoric of their former occupiers. Others felt glee in knowing that now it would be Ukrainians who would be put first. But to those that did not match the idealized image of the pure Ukrainian man - they shuddered at the prospect of the Nazi ideology long outlasting its German creators."
UPA_CivilWar.5.a: "New boss, same as the old boss."

UPA_CivilWar.6.t: "A Final Minute"
UPA_CivilWar.6.d: "The office was quiet, far too quiet for working hours. At first, Ivanko was certain no one had come in today. Then he noticed the drinks left on countertops, the papers strewn around the secretary's desk. At first, it seemed unusual, but not impossible. Ivanko and his comrades were UNRA men, now trapped in a UPA world. Ivanko knew the paper was bound to shutter eventually.\n\nBut why would they disband without telling him?\n\nAfter glancing across the room, Ivanko noticed two men in the printer's room. He couldn't tell who they were - strangers, clearly. They were reading next week's issue, drawing on the pages and talking to each other.\n\nOne of the men, the taller, had a gun on his back. And as Ivanko looked closer, he could see bands of red and black around his shoulder.\n\nThen, Ivanko noticed the crimson stain in the hardwood. In a few places, it even seemed wet.\n\nThe journalist turned around, hoping to run back to his home, praying that his name had been lost in the chaos. He didn't see that one soldier had already turned his head towards Ivanko, and was slinging his rifle from his shoulder."
UPA_CivilWar.6.a: "Ivanko joined his comrades moments later."

UPA_CivilWar.7.t: "The Factory of Damocles"
UPA_CivilWar.7.d: "Ivan, the UPA's new foreman of Vinnytsia Heavy Appliances, stared out through his office window towards lines of workers, humming away at their stations. He held a glass of German wine to his lips, and drank deeply. As the wine fell into his stomach, he cursed the commander who had named him the foreman. How could that man see Ivan as fit for this curse?\n\nThe cloud hanging over Ivan's factory was one of expertise. The UPA had appointed him based on "experience", but experience meant nothing to a factory line. Before the UPA came, Ivan was merely a slave to the Germans, knowing only of his single station. The true knowledge of this factory laid in the brains of the engineers and foremans, pushed in front of a firing squad and then splattered on the southward wall.\n\nIn other words, if anything in this factory broke, Ivan had no answers.\n\nFor now, Ivan was a hero to the UPA. But if the factory faced an accident, if a machine broke down, if even the electricity went out, Ivan would no longer be viewed so kindly. He'd be investigated for treason, mismanagement, and conspiracy against his nation. And really, that could only end one way.\n\nIvan had tried to convince himself a better outcome was possible. Maybe a promotion could come faster than an accident. Maybe Ivan would find enough time to escape. But either relied on the factory running smoothly, for even a month or so. And Aryan factories relied on a certain level of... Ukrainian expendability.\n\nIvan tasted the wine on his lips. If this was to be his last drink, he'd picked a fine wine to go out on."
UPA_CivilWar.7.a: "He spent the rest of the day finishing the bottle."

UPA_CivilWar.8.t: "Simple Pleasures"
UPA_CivilWar.8.d: "August was not the type of person to complain; such talk did not make a good soldier. He was not like his comrades in the great war against Bolshevism who complained of poor rations and the never ending mud. No, August took these trials in stride. The iron crosses hung upon his office wall once stood as a testament to that. "Ah, nostalgia". He mentally chided himself - that too was a sign of weakness.\n\nAugust's work was never below average, so he was rarely shouted at by the guards, but his lazy good for nothing they deigned to call his co-workers couldn't shine a shell casing to save their lives.\n\nOne of the guards shouted behind him. "FASTER FASTER, if you wish to eat some time today FASTER!".\n\nAugust didn't jump. He could feel the guard stomp off in defeat. He had a spine of iron and no teenager with a rifle could bend it. He returned to his work. He polished the cases, making them shine. A minute later there was the next batch, and his work was no less pristine. The next batch simply couldn't be cleaned; no matter what he did, a reddish-brown stain just seemed to saturate the case further. He began to grumble about stupid workers trying to cut themselves to get out of work, but he noticed a slight pain in his thumb. It was profusely bleeding. He sucked it and returned to his work.\n\nAugust never really had "breaks". Only short periods were food was practically thrown at him and he was given a few short minutes to wolf it down before returning to the assembly line. As he ate his gruel, he noted his compatriots. They were shifty eyed, bald men, whose eyes were all turned downward in an animalistic effort to the food in their bowl, or prowling the floor for scraps. August knew these men, if not by name, or face, then by countenance. He had overseen them for years, he had heard their mumblings about freedom and German tyrants and all other such things, and yet here they stayed."
UPA_CivilWar.8.a: "Forever with him."

UPA_CivilWar.9.t: "Requiem Bells"
UPA_CivilWar.9.d: ""It is my opinion, friends, that our crusade is not yet complete. Not in the slightest! We may have liberated our nation from the Teutonic yoke, crushed the Bolshevists, and seen our flag rise from the Don to Volyn, but we have yet to truly see all of Ukraine out from under the foreign boot. It remains pressed upon our necks as we cast weary eyes towards Germany, as we watch our people cower before the thought of their bombs, as we pray for mercy from the foreign enemy..."\n\nYaroslav Stetsko sat at rapt attention, faces, and knuckles pale. This was it, there was no turning back. He knew this was coming, deep down. He remembered the furious campsite declarations, the frenzied murmurings, he even foggily remembered those maps on the peeled, faded propaganda posters displayed on forgotten town billboards, and what they had promised.\n\n"...Who are they? Those traitors, those backbiters, those doubters? Why some sit among us!"\nStetsko stared ahead, his face turning almost yellow. Dear god just utter the words, end this damned experiment. Perhaps the Germans would make his death short.\n\n"We march soon. Our armies are ready. The blood of our people cries out for justice for those who so unjustly spilled it. The honor and sanctity of Ukraine will never be preserved unless we go south, to reclaim our peninsula! The national flag shall fly above Sevastopol!".\n\nThey all cheered, as Dymtro Klyachkivsky sank to his seat, his face emotionless."
UPA_CivilWar.9.a: "The bell hath tolled."

UPA_CivilWar.10.t: "Victory, Total and Unquestionable"
UPA_CivilWar.10.d: "All of them had been wrong. All of them had doubted him. All of them lacked ambition, drive, and true patriotism. Only he, Dymtro Klyachkivsky would go down in history as the liberator of the Crimea! His march through Sevastopol would be remembered just as Scipio's triumph! Only he had truly achieved Bandera's dream!\n\nThe streets of the city lay in ruins. Rubble stood where once the Teutonic monoliths had clouded the skies, while mud permeated where sumptuous, decadent parks once ambled along. Shukhevych stared blankly at it all.\n\n"We won! Only a few years ago we thought the day would never come!"\n\nKlyachkivsky slapped Shukhevych on the back, nearly knocking him off-balance.\n\n"I suppose," he said blankly.\n\n"You suppose?" Klyachkivsky sighed, chuckling slightly.\n\n"There are still Germans here and in the countryside. We haven't cleared all of the garrisons yet, and the Tatars aren't pleased. I have already heard reports of insurrection in the Yalu..." "And they shall be crushed!" Klyachkivsky snapped, his predatory grin fading slightly. "They have nothing here anymore. Their estates will be parceled out, some of the soldiers have already brought their families, and the Tatars can be bought off with some of them as well. The garrisons will wither."\n\n"You worry too much."\n\nKlyachkivsky turned, gazing out at the harbor. At least he had come, unlike Stetsko. Stetsko was too busy whimpering in Kyiv."
UPA_CivilWar.10.a: "They know not of victory, even when standing amidst it."

### Fraternal Coup events ###

BOV_fraternal_coup.1.t: "Stetsko's Gambit"
BOV_fraternal_coup.1.d: ""Damn his lack of sense!" Stetsko sputtered as he stumbled around his office, gathering paper for his typewriter. The usually composed man had become fraught with nervous meltdowns since Klyachkivsky had ordered the assault on Crimea, and his victory had only driven the visionary further into erratic fervor.\n\n"His lack of restraint will certainly get us all killed," Rebet added. Stress did not treat the man kindly, as sweat drenched his bald head with an anxious sheen.\n\n"If the Vozhd is going to act like a rabid animal, then he should be put down," Lebed coldly added with a sneer. "It's becoming harder to hide my tracks; soon enough, he'll have our heads."\n\n"Which is precisely why I've summoned both of you here," Stetsko exclaimed as he began to type furiously. "There will be no peace and no Ukraine should we sit idly and let a false destiny claim our lives." The typewriter's rapid clicks filled the silence as Stetsko's voice began to crescendo. "Only two paths lie before us. One to an early grave, and one to a glorious victory. Just as Bandera challenged Melnyk's wicked corruption, so too must we purge our ranks of a Vozhd whose ambitions betray our ideals." Stetsko removed the page from the typewriter and handed it to Rebet. "Deliver this to Maivsky without delay."\n\n"And what would you have me do?" Lebed inquired.\n\n"Monitor our dear Vozhd. I trust you know what to do when the opportunity arises," Stetsko responded with a sardonic grin."
BOV_fraternal_coup.1.a: "And thus, Mephisto began his waltz."

BOV_fraternal_coup.2.t: "Brothers of Defiance"
BOV_fraternal_coup.2.d: "Highly respected general,\n\nI must congratulate you on your triumphant liberation of our dear Ukraine. Through your martial prowess, our people can finally embrace the freedom robbed from them for four decades. God has looked down favorably on your command, and I pray that he continues to bless your path.\n\nI must also confess that I do not write to you with honest intentions but with those of a deceitful brigand. I regret that it has come to this, but the actions of the Vozhd threaten the future you have won for our nation. Yaroslav is formulating a plan to liberate us from the Vozhd's tyrannical gaze once and for all, and so I write to you, dear friend, to inform you of our plight.\n\nI'm aware that asking you to commit treason against the nation you have just freed betrays your principles, but I hope that within your heart you will see the righteousness of our cause. If my request is too demanding, then I implore you to pretend that this letter does not exist for the sake of your men. I will pray for the safety and health of you and your family in these turbulent times. Ukraine needs every hero it has; I only ask that you not abandon her now in her time of great need.\n\nWith true respect,\n\nL. Rebet"
BOV_fraternal_coup.2.a: "An earnest plea reaches opportunistic eyes."

BOV_fraternal_coup.3.t: "The Patrician's Play"
BOV_fraternal_coup.3.d: ""A plot to overthrow the Vozhd? It's not often we get to follow in Bandera's footsteps," Kuk muttered with a sarcastic drone.\n\n"An opportunity to do as Bandera did is a rare occasion indeed," Pozychanyuk chimed in with a wry smile, "and it would be a waste to squander Rebet's friendship."\n\n"Drop the treasonous talk," Shukhevych growled. "You shouldn't fall for such honeyed words either. Stetsko is the mastermind behind this scheme; it's entirely possible that Lev has become another one of his puppets." Truthfully, Shukhevych did not know what to do with the letter. He had considered torching it without saying a word; that would've been the correct choice, and yet he summoned his advisors for their input. "I will remind all of you once that as officers of the army, you are to maintain discipline at all times."\n\n"I apologize; I should not have allowed my eagerness to cloud my judgment," Pozychanyuk replied.\n\n"However," Kuk interjected, "his point is valid; if there was ever a chance to force the Vozhd to reform or resign, this is it." Shukhevych could not deny his subordinate's observations. Perhaps he summoned them to validate a feeling he had denied? Strong men follow their desires and seize what rightfully belongs to them. Would he allow himself to be subordinated to a weasel to escape the illogical wrath of a feral animal? No. He would not be sidelined again.\n\n"Perhaps I was too quick to judge your words as treason," Shukhevych said. "It wouldn't be our fault if word of the Vozhd's fall reached us too late after all.""
BOV_fraternal_coup.3.a: "A third joins the devil's dance."

BOV_fraternal_coup.4.t: "The Outlander"
BOV_fraternal_coup.4.d: "Klyachkivsky looked at the great city of Kyiv from his window. The edifices that sprawled before him were distorted by his own tired reflection. Klyachkivsky could not help but stare at the specter that stared back at him from the window. His eyes, ringed by darkness, bore into his very psyche as the weight of many sleepless nights crushed his consciousness. Was this ancient man, this walking husk in the mirror, really him? Of course. Was it not what he deserved for his weakness that allowed the UPA to be subverted from within?\n\nThe rising sun's accusatory glare burst through the window, momentarily blinding the Vozhd. As the stars left Klyachkivsky's withered eyes, he could only gaze upon the shining city outside his window. Kyiv, such a glorious and ancient city, conquered by foreigners yet never truly lost to the Ukrainian people, was alien to him. The gleaming optimism of the warm city outside his office had not once been felt by the Vozhd, who had lurked in the damp thickets and hillocks of Galicia for nearly fifteen years. The starving bogs that could swallow men whole were naught but a memory, and yet the unknown city expanse before him was equally overwhelming.\n\nIt was unacceptable, Klyachkivsky thought to himself, that a Vozhd could ever be unfamiliar with the crown jewel of his great nation. So, the Vozhd donned his coat and called for his bodyguard. A tour was in order for the city's greatest liberator."
BOV_fraternal_coup.4.a: "And so the Vozhd began to open his heart. Pathetic."

BOV_fraternal_coup.5.t: "Duplicity Duped"
BOV_fraternal_coup.5.d: "As Klyachkivsky returned to the headquarters, he could sense the change in atmosphere. Through the expressions on the faces of the (more numerous guards). On the sudden speed with which his driver raced through the gates.\n\nExiting his vehicle, he loudly demanded to know what had happened, and as the hard faces of the soldiers gave way to the shaken visage of Lenkavskyi, he obtained his answer. There had been an attack, and had things gone only slightly differently, the building would have been occupied by insurrectionists rather than loyal guards.\n\nExplaining the timeline of the assault, Lenkavskyi described the sudden attempt at storming and capture that had been made. He rushed through the desperate defense then explained the eventual victory - and the capture of some of the attackers, miserable men now huddled at gunpoint in the corner of the courtyard. Under his harsh interrogation, they admitted the identity of their master - Stetsko.\n\nAt that, Klyachkivsky silently nodded, and turned. As he walked away, several guards brought rope with which to form a makeshift noose around a lamppost. The unfortunate attackers would no doubt be the first of many hoisted as such."
BOV_fraternal_coup.5.a: "A close call, indeed."

BOV_fraternal_coup.6.t: "The Trapped Weasel"
BOV_fraternal_coup.6.d: "The nondescript exterior of the small building, tucked away on a quiet side street, belied the importance of the events that had been set in motion within it.\n\nAt a small table behind the barred door sat a table, and around that table sat three men who had put their plan into motion. Klyachkivsky had to fall, they all knew, if they were to secure the future of Ukraine, and though many events had been set into motion the one most important - Klyachkivsky's actual death - had yet to succeed, and had yet to return any information from those assigned to it at all.\n\nThe arguments between Stetsko, Rebet, and Lebed started quietly, but grew quickly in earnest. Had it occurred? Had it been foiled? Were there oversights in the plan? Surely not, Stetsko worked to assure the others. They just had to be patient, and keep confidence.\n\nThat confidence was soon shattered by the sound of trucks arriving, and the harsh shouting of orders from both the front and rear of the building. Moments later the door shattered inward, and as the soldiers rushed in, quickly arresting all three of them, the answer was definitively given.\n\nAs he was being led away (to a fate he could well imagine), Stetsko could not for the life of him understand what had gone wrong. Had someone talked? Been turned weeks ago? Or was it a simple coincidence, a right turn instead of a left?\n\nHe imagined he would never know."
BOV_fraternal_coup.6.a: "He was right."

BOV_fraternal_coup.7.t: "A Deep Cleanse"
BOV_fraternal_coup.7.d: "In the aftermath of Stetsko's attempt at coup, the many generals of the UPA - especially those who had not been entirely aligned behind Klyachkivsky - had been summoned to headquarters. There was no room for dissent or delay, they all knew, not now. Not while they were being watched.\n\nDespite extreme levels of security, the mood in the assembly room was nervous in the extreme - for none knew, or could say with any certainty, how involved anyone else had been in the attempt. When Klyachkivsky himself entered and began his speech, the mood darkened even further, and with rapidity.\n\nHe railed against the treason of Stetsko, and began reading names of those whose involvement had been 'discovered.' With each name came strong arms pulling them away, out and away from the room. The list went on, and the more politically aware among the leadership realized that beyond purging Stetsko's confederates, Klyachkivsky was also removing anyone he had suspicions about. He now had the political capital, and was using it decisively.\n\nSome of the names were expected, but when Shukhevych and his closest allies were identified, the room went silent. For a moment all thought there was to be violence, but more guards entered and, grossly outnumbered, they had no alternative but to surrender. As he left under guard, those that remained understood the threat well. There would be no further dissent permitted - of any kind."
BOV_fraternal_coup.7.a: "Another threat removed."

BOV_fraternal_coup.8.t: "Triumph of the Vozhd"
BOV_fraternal_coup.8.d: "Although the morning in question was not particularly cold, those in attendance were chilled to the bone. Almost overnight, and in the aftermath of Stetsko's coup attempt, the entire political order of the UPA had been overturned. Factionalism, or at least factionalism against Klyachkivsky, was to end today. With the end of those who had been leading it. The gallows had been assembled the night before, sturdily built and prepared to hold their imminent burden for many nights to come. For many examples to be set.\n\nThe guards arrived first, followed by those ranking members of the UPA who had been deemed 'loyal' to Shukhevych. Arranged in careful squares - and watched, they noticed, by hard-eyed and well-armed soldiers - they awaited the arrival of the other groups. One by one they came. First the Vozhd's confidantes and most trustworthy officers. Then the Vozhd himself, taking a place of prominence. And then, finally, the condemned, to a one looking intentionally pathetic in the sackcloth they had been given.\n\nThe event itself was swift. The charges were read out as Stetsko, Shukhevych, and many others were led forward and placed on the gallows, the nooses tightened. With only a single nod from Klyachkivsky the lever was pulled, the figures dropped, and the sharp crack of breaking bones echoed through the square.\n\nThe bodies were left hanging as the forced crowd departed. They would not be taken down for many weeks."
BOV_fraternal_coup.8.a: "Absolute control."

BOV_fraternal_coup.9.t: "A Perfect Kill"
BOV_fraternal_coup.9.d: "As the vehicle rumbled through the city streets, Klyachkivsky thought of the business that awaited him in the immediate future.\n\nThe UPA - his UPA - was not secure. Stetsko, Shukhevych, and so many others fought him for control, for influence, and for the right to determine the destiny of Ukraine.

A coordinated purge, whereby-\n\nAlarm raced through his mind as his driver made a sudden - and unexpected - turn into an alleyway. Demanding explanation, none was given as he saw, out of the corner of his eye, the barrel of a machine gun extending from a window high above. The gunfire that followed wiped all thoughts from his mind forever more.\n\nWhen it was over, the would-be Vozhd lay dead, riddled with bullets. Locals soon arrived, attracted by the noise. Though they were shocked by the identity of the dead man, none could explain what had happened, not to each other nor to the soldiers who rapidly descended upon the scene.\n\nOne of the most powerful men in Ukraine had been killed - and there was not a witness to be found. That spoke volumes in itself."

BOV_fraternal_coup.10.d: "The old doors of the government building creaked as Stetsko burst through them. He could only anticipate the grisly scene that would give way to his majestic vision, and yet the absence of corpses and bloodstains was an ill omen. The clomping of enraged boots announced the arrival of an inflamed Lenkavskyi, who stormed towards Stetsko.\n\n"Yaroslav!" Lenkavskyi yelled. "How convenient that a craven like you fortuitously arrives after a failed attempt on our lives!" Lenkavskyi's incensed rage echoed through the halls, catching the attention of the surviving guards.\n\n"I heard that the Vozhd had been assassinated and arrived as swiftly as I was able," Stetsko crooned. "The nation needs stability, Stepan, and a wise hand to steer it," Stetsko barbed. "Since when was it criminal to answer the nation's call in its time of need?"\n\n"We'll know who the criminals are when we finish interrogating the assailants we captured," Lenskavsky retorted as he turned away. "Only one punishment awaits traitors, Yaroslav: death. I will not rest until justice has reaped the life of every turncoat. Even if that means killing you," Lenkavskyi said before leaving Stetsko behind.\n\nStetsko was left speechless, having no counter to snipe back with. He stepped out of the building to return to his car. His soldiers didn't just make a mistake; they managed to jeopardize the entire operation. Lenkavskyi lived - he would not rest until he collected a butcher's toll as retribution."

Men who are too spineless, cowardly, and incapable are to learn discipline and heroism from their superiors. Such is the natural way of the world, and yet every breath Stetsko took with his asthmatic lungs defied that principle. Was it not fated by nature that Stetsko would fail because of his own spiritless timidity? The failed assault upon Klyachkivsky's lackeys had left no opportunity for Shukhevych to intervene, and so he was left to stew as Lenkavskyi ordained his guilt in the background.\n\nTo idle in anticipation of death is no better than putting a bullet through the brain, Shukhevych had surmised. The dying embers of his fireplace devoured their final meal of detritus from Rebet's letter. Shukhevych took a long gaze at a framed picture of him, his wife, and his children mounted upon the mantle. Such a thing was a luxury during the insurgency, yet the generosity of a photographer immortalized the fleeting smiles of a family that knew only strife. Everlasting war had already robbed many children of their fathers; he could not and would not allow it to claim him too.\n\nThe exodus west to their hideouts in Galicia was an earnest affair. Fifteen years of fighting for survival had long hardened Shukhevych's men; another year would only be another notch on the belt of tragic sorrows. For family, for a better future, for Ukraine, they must live."

I should have known it would fail."\n\nThe aged, bespectacled man grumbled angrily to himself. No one paid attention, for it was not the first time he had said something to that effect. Yaroslav Stetsko had been, in all respects, a wreck since they had hastily departed Kyiv. He had become withdrawn from his family and friends, taken to merely his books and mumbling to himself about what had gone wrong.\n\n"It was all for naught, it was all for naught. What we should we do when we depart? The Germans will never forgive me..."\nStetsko's thoughts swirled. But for the first time since he had crawled into this stuffed cramped vehicle he had an idea. The Germans, yes, the Germans; they would hang him of course... But would they really? He was a mutineer against treason and the madman Klyachkivksy, he was a sane administrator. Zaporizhzhya may be their salvation! Legions of loyalists desperate for pardon and stability, a functioning grain market, and loyal intelligent Ukrainians? What more could they want?\n\n"Of course!" He cried suddenly, nearly sending the driver careening off the road. "Men we shall decamp into the city and end this idiocy. We shall form a new government!". Everyone in the car was still somewhat shaken by almost meeting their maker, and they played along with the suggestion. While they did not exactly expect to curl up and die when they reached their destination, the formation of civil administration was certainly not at the top list of their priorities. "Yes, yes, I shall contact them all," Stetsko continued eagerly, scribbling out his thoughts in an open book."

Additionally, unlike the previous purges, Lenkavskyi targeted the most powerful leaders, calling for Stetsko and Shukhyevch to stand trial. As a result, it was unsurprising that, unlike previous purges, someone would dare to fight back.\n\nThe fires of rebellion had quickly engulfed most of Ukraine. Shukhevych had taken most of the organized army with him to the west, and Stetsko's absent bureaucrats left Lenkavskyi with a state hollow of functionality as they built a rival government in the south. The odds were against the true followers of Bandera's will, yet they would bleed for Ukraine's future all the same.\n\nThe Ukrainian Civil War did not end with Klyachkivsky's victory; it had only taken a brief pause. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army, whose rotten foundation had endured relentless punishment, had reached its limit as three ambitious men rallied their followers to a new war. Bandera can only watch from the heavens as the men he called brothers destroy everything he fought for."

It was a flawless purge, an orchestration of chaos so perfect that a smirk broke through the man's steely countenance. Myron and Lenkavskyi, the two biggest obstacles to his ambitions, were naught but corpses, but Stetsko was really doing them a favor. After all, their ideas would live on through him rather than die with a paranoid Vozhd's mad crusade. It was unfathomable why smart men like them would fail to realize such a simple truth. The harsh slam of a door interrupted Stetsko's thoughts as Shukhevych entered opposite of him, flanked by his bodyguards.\n\nThe grim general and the bold bureaucrat immediately made eye contact as their poker faces held firm. The eerie quiet was broken by the occasional crackle of gunfire in the distance, which grew closer by the second. Stetsko's thoughts raced through his head. This wasn't part of the plan. Roman shouldn't be here. Shukhevych's piercing glare made Stetsko feel exposed, and that was the moment everything made sense. Shukhevych knew everything!\n\nStetsko weighed his options. Even if Shukhevych approved of the plan, the stubborn mule would likely remain unconvinced no matter how correct his ideas were. The twitch of a corpse nearby caught Stetsko's eye. The solution to his problem was obvious. The missing piece of the puzzle was right in front of him: the scapegoat."

The general himself only trotted along, like a patient hunter confident in the ensnarement of his prey. His men had already begun apprehending Stetsko's killers; there was nowhere for the weasel to flee. A traitor was going to die, and for the first time in a long while, Shukhevych was going to be happy about it.\n\nStetsko did not make it far before a guard lunged and tackled him to the floor. A few of his hitmen ran to his aid, only to be shot by the rest of Shukhevych's guards upon entry. Stetsko was dragged across the floor, wheezing from the burst of physical exertion. The battered ideologue looked up at Shukhevych with a bloody nose and cracked glasses.\n\n"What is the meaning of this Roman?" Stetsko gasped.\n\n"I should be asking you that question.

Stetsko's agitation subsided. "Our interests are clearly aligned, Roman, so why don't we work together?" Shukhevych paused, feigning contemplation.\n\n"The punishment for treason is death," Shukhevych coldly uttered before he unholstered his pistol and fired it straight into Stetsko's skull. The weak man's body fell limp as his brain matter spilled onto the tile. Shukhevych did not spare him a second glance as he left the room. There was work to be done."

BOV_fraternal_coup.16.d: "Shukhevych thought it ironic that his first actions as Vozhd would be executing his foes, yet disposing of the nation's enemies was the duty of every patriot, even if they were also Ukrainian. It was a well-kept secret that Stetsko's wife, Slava, was publishing dissent under the guise of pseudonyms, but with the mask shattered, she would have to reflect on her actions for the rest of her life in prison. Shukhevych was no stranger to mercy after all, and while Slava's silver tongue undermined his cause, she was performing her role as a dutiful wife and would get leniency for it.\n\nShukhevych could not extend that mercy to the fools that went along with Stetsko's plot. While the generals were innocent of direct involvement, their shortsighted loyalties made them a significant liability. Retiring them with medals would keep them far away from power while keeping their honor intact.\n\nAs for Stetsko's closest allies, Piasetsky, Lebed, and Rebet, they would all have to perish. Piasetsky was a tool who let his discontent become arrogant ambition, incapable of providing for a cause that demands sacrifice. Lebed, the great orchestrator of purges, had disappeared, and many would take solace in his death were he to be found. Rebet gave the old general pause; he was the lynchpin in revealing Stetsko's treachery, but he was also a key plotter too. Rebet was a good man with good intentions, but a traitor was a traitor all the same. Rebet had to die with the rest.\n\nShukhevych signed the warrants with a hesitant pen. When Klyachkivsky had purged Fedun, they had lost far more than they had gained. He could only hope that this purge would be the last, lest he become what he despised."

For decades, he had served Ukraine with excellency, but despite this, he felt dissatisfaction. Stetsko's biting accusation would've been true had the weasel not acted first. If he hadn't felt guilty about such a fact, the only evidence of his potential collusion wouldn't be cinders and ash. It would be pointless deceit to assert he had no ambition of his own, for he was now Vozhd, a title that required a strong man to wield effectively. What would Konovalets do?\n\nThe question stuck with Shukhevych. He first met the original Vozhd as a teenager while he rented a room from their family's hotel. Konovalets' tales of war and struggle for Ukrainian freedom inspired him to rise to the occasion, and he had won Ukraine's freedom, but at what cost? He had fought his Ukrainian brethren just as much as he fought the German oppressor. Had Bandera even been right in splitting so violently from Melnyk? Could all the bloodshed have been avoided? They clearly strayed from Konovalet's will. His mentor didn't pull the trigger for a reason, and they foolishly allowed Melnyk's corruption to fester because of their own shortsighted fanaticism. Were they all fools for not realizing something so obvious?\n\nShukhevych was now Vozhd, with a weaker and more disunified Ukraine than during the time of Konovalets. It would not be enough to replicate the actions of his wise mentor; he would have to be better, stronger, and smarter. Ukraine must be more than petty political squabbles, for it will not survive if its powerful spirit is not whole. Ukraine's glory shall be eternal; the Vozhd must make it so."

A momentary delay was encountered when the sounds of the soldiers, encountering other radio engineers less favorable to oversight and opening fire immediately, overwhelmed the microphone. But as the gunfire died down, Stetsko's voice increased in intensity.\n\nHis message was simple, yet unmistakable. Shukhevych, and those loyal to him, had betrayed Ukraine: they had collaborated with invaders, subversives, and degenerates all, with the end goal being the dismemberment of the state for personal enrichment. He provided a long list of 'evidence' to support this, trusting that quantity would overwhelm quantity, and promised harsh punishment.\n\nJustice would be dispensed, Stetsko proclaimed, in good time. Shukhevych would not escape, nor would anyone affiliated with him, assisting him, or enabling him in any fashion. And once they were punished for their actions? Well, then, Ukraine would be truly protected from subversion.\n\nAnother gunshot rang out from somewhere in the station. Stetsko ended the address."

He had faced death many times before, from many different people, organizations, and countries, in his quest to bring his vision of Ukraine about, and he was ready to embrace it. But as he was tied to the post, looking across to where the firing squad would stand, he could see his son being led across the square, blindfolded as he had been, and his heart sank.\n\nThey had tried to escape together, doing so himself only to make sure that his son would live, but had failed. Those who had stolen the country had been just as efficient as Shukhevych knew he himself would have been in tracking down their enemies, and once captured they had quickly been bundled here.\n\nAs his son was similarly tied to the post they exchanged their final words.

These new policemen were different, they may have been on the opposite side of the bars in certain cases, but they were loyal, at least, that's what the recruiter said.\n\nHe had lied, everyone lied to Klyachkivsky, and he knew it.\n\nThe hall was cold, and the heating system had died, few knew how to fix old Soviet contraptions, and even those who did were unlikely to even come close to the buildings of the volatile government. No windows let in any of the tepid warmth of sunlight, let alone its glow. All that illuminated the police conscript was a single flickering lantern just above their heads.\n\nFootsteps, many of them. The recruits, the smart ones at least, tensed up. This was their moment.\n\nKlyachkivsky was far less imposing in person than the myriad propaganda posters of the regime made him out to be. He was a sad figure in person, his skin drawn taught over his features, his brow bore a now permanent furrow, and his moth seemed sucked into a forever scowl. He silently appraised each and every new policeman, stopping before none, yet making each feel as though he had stared into their very souls. Finally, he stopped, briskly walking back to the entrance, guards following closely behind. The door slammed, and most of the men flinched."

He had been embezzling funds, stealing from the scant revenues that had been tortuously collected and which were vital for the operation of the state as a whole, and the Vozhd had clearly decided that it was an issue he would personally attend to.\n\nThey all listened to the man who they had worked beside beg for his life, pleading at how there had been no choice, that his children were starving, and that he had to find funds for them. They all knew he spoke the truth, many of them being in a similar situation and hoping that their own thefts had not been similarly discovered.\n\nThe Vozhd listened carefully. At the end of it all those watching saw him make a single nod as he pulled the man to his feet. He would be merciful. He understood their plight. And so the man would not be executed. But he would pay for his theft, at a ratio of four-to-one. In fingers. The man's relief turned to terror as the bodyguards rushed forward. As the hammer came out.

Finally, he set the folder down gently.\n\n"Get me the generals, tell them it's about the situation in Galicia. I want you to take minutes."\n\nFew men openly disobeyed the Vozhd, and his generals weren't among them. Klyachkivsky sat silently at his desk in front of his top brass, emotionless, his pale eyes staring at each one. "This..." he said softly, pushing the folder to the middle of the desk. "...is unacceptable." The generals stole glances at one another, but not one spoke.\n\n"Galicia is the embryo of our movement. It is the hotbed of Ukrainian National thought and it is the seedbed for our dear departed Stepan Bandera." Every man was silent for a moment to honor that dead demigod. "Yet now, it is a battleground, one which we seem to be losing." Klyachkivsky's tone broke into a growl for a moment. "I want every Pole in that land buried in it or out of it. We all do, yet it seems you have been soft-hearted. Kill the bombers' families, burn their farms, kill any who shelter them, and liquidate on sight. How hard is that!" Kliachesky slammed his fist on the desk, making the generals flinch.\n\n"Sir, we can't expect the Poles not to do likewise, any more of that and they'll start targeting the civilians..." One general stuttered. He quickly realized his mistake.\n\n"Perhaps they should! Perhaps it is time the Ukranian people learn the nature of racial conflict and learn a Ukranian state can not exist unless it is populated only by Ukranians! No half measures, break open the caches! Give farmboys rifles and tell them to shoot Poles like fowl if you have to!" Klyachkivsky ranted and raved. The generals emerged, with one solution duly hammered into each of their heads."

The captor's sinister grin sent shivers down his spine as he sat, immobilized and bound to a rickety wooden chair. Sweat poured from his brow, betraying the overwhelming fear that gripped him.\n\n"You will talk," the interrogator said menacingly, his hand closing around the prisoner's throat. "Perhaps you might just be spared if you do so quickly."\n\nDesperation took hold, and the captive Melnykite began to shout out the names and locations of his fellow OUN-M members. He hoped against hope that his cooperation would be enough to save him.\n\nThe interrogator laughed, a cold, heartless sound that reverberated throughout the room. "You Melnykites have grown weak. It's no wonder, given how you let Germany trample us for two decades without resistance. Now, it's our turn to trample you. A true Ukrainian would never betray his comrades; he'd die a thousand times over for his country! You, traitors, squandered your chance at redemption a long ago, and we won't be as forgiving as the Germans."\n\nThe prisoner's heart sank as the interrogator's laughter filled the room, echoing in his ears. He had only moments to realize the futility of his cooperation before the gun was cocked, and his vision faded to black."

BOV_Klyachkivsky_buildup.10.d: "The intermittent sounds of gunfire were only broken up by the noises of soldiers moving outside the door, as Klyachkivsky's men continued their attempts to break in. Sushko knew that sooner or later, they would, and this hunt would come to an end.\n\n"It's funny, isn't it?" Stsiborskyi mused tiredly as he leaned against the wall. "After everything, this is how Yevhen's cause dies." He gave a hollow chuckle. "What a sad end."\n\nSushko could only nod silently. Neither of them had seen entirely eye-to-eye, but they had understood each other. As far as people to die with, he hadn't expected it would be Stsiborskyi, but he supposed there were worse men. How few of those were left now, thanks to Klyachkivsky.\n\n"And to think, only a few decades ago, we were so close," Sushko murmured, almost to himself. "We were united. Successful. There was a purpose. Before..." he exhaled, shaking his head. "No one but Konovalets could have done it. Once he was gone..."\n\n"It all came crashing down. Aye, those were the days," Stsiborskyi agreed. "Good times, good memories." There was shouting outside. It seemed they'd found the entrance. Stsiborskyi sat down, looking at the door. "I think we've still got a little time. Let's reminisce a little before it ends."\n\nAs the rest of Klyachkivsky's men continued working, both men spent the time reflecting on their lives, their cause, and the times where things had not been so bleak. There were few smiles or laughs, but they had grown numb to their fate, even as they mourned what had become of the cause.\n\nBattering rams smashed the door down, and both men barely were able to react before the barrels of rifles poked in, and fired in an unceremonious barrage."

BOV_Klyachkivsky_buildup.11.d: "Klyachkivsky's icy smile was fixed on his face as he stood before the soldiers of Ukraine. As the sun beat down on them, he savored the moment. It was today where his legacy would be cemented, and history would revere him as the man who had saved Ukraine. Because of him, Ukraine would be whole. Because of him, the humiliation of Galicia would be avenged. Because of him, Bandera's vision would be fulfilled.\n\n"Soldiers, friends," he began, his demeanor calm, his voice stern. "Today, we correct an injustice that has been inflicted on the Ukrainian people. Today we reunite with our people who have been oppressed and persecuted by their Polish butchers." His voice turned colder, as raw disdain warped the words. "The Poles believed they could rule our people, and hold our land with impunity."\n\nHe allowed a pause, his eyes unblinking as each word was carefully enunciated. "This delusion ends today. Galicia is Ukrainian, one and indivisible."\n\nThere was a loud roar of approval from the soldiers. It was the call of men whose blood was hot, raging, and screaming for battle. Klyachkivsky made a gesture, and the noise instantly died. "Galicia is more than our land. It is where the birthplace of our movement began, and the home of Bandera himself."\n\nHe indicated behind him, in the general direction of Galicia. "Today we fight for more than just Ukraine, but to liberate the home of one of Ukraine's greatest men. Once our victory is achieved, there will be none who will deny that Ukraine belongs to none but the Ukrainians!"\n\nKlyachkivsky allowed a moment for the cheers of the soldier to endure; to allow them to bask in the moment before the fighting began. The cold smile on his face grew just a bit wider. Yes, he was certain they were going to succeed."

Quite out of the ordinary for the Galician campaign in general, of course, but a welcome change nonetheless. The officer in charge of the force was eager to move on, move forward.\n\nBut there was one task that had to be taken care of first. And an important resource consideration besides.\n\nStepping out of his command car, he conferred with the other officers as he looked over at the town square, where hundreds of Polish civilians, the town inhabitants, stood. Quiet and huddled together, he noticed how few young men there were among them. That was good, he thought, for what was to come.\n\nThere was no provision, he explained to the officers, for saboteurs in the rear. The Vozhd had made the perfidy of the Poles very clear and they could not leave them to cause mischief, as their men clearly already had that morning. At the same time, however, supplies were scarce. The morning clash had used far more ammunition than expected, and what remained needed to be conserved for the next fight.\n\nHe departed soon after, instructing them to form up their units after they were done.

As the Ukrainian army advanced through the city, the Polish population found themselves at the mercy of the invaders, a mercy that was not granted. Homes were ransacked, monuments destroyed, and lives uprooted. The scenes were nearly identical to those two decades earlier however, this time, there was even less to lose.\n\nAmidst the turmoil, a young Polish woman named Marta huddled in the corner of her family's home, tightly clutching her younger brother, Piotr, to her chest. The sounds of gunfire and screams filled the air, and Marta prayed they would be spared from the violence outside their door.\n\nThe soldiers, driven by Klyachkivsky's vision, were relentless in their pursuit of death. They moved from house to house, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. The terror that had gripped the city was no accident but rather a calculated act of aggression designed to instill fear and submission, a warning of things of even worse things to come.\n\nWith the cloak of night, Marta and Piotr ventured out of their hiding place as they heard both flame and soldiers come ever closer. Desperate to find safety, The siblings navigated through the devastated streets, the sights and sounds of the brutal invasion haunting them at every turn. They knew that the home they had once known was gone, their few years of freedom being taken once again.They gazed from the hillside that overlooked their former home. Years of memories disappeared in an hour. They had little time to stare as the Ukrainian advance continued."

"You need to hide," her husband said quietly, sitting near the window. "Take the kids to the cellar and stay there. If you're with me when they come, they'll kill you too."\n\nShe knew they would. These Banderites were monsters, with a particular hatred of Poles. While Ruslana was Ukrainian, and might have lived through their brutality, her husband was a Pole. In the eyes of the Banderites, it was an unholy union, and they would almost certainly kill her along with him.\n\n"I'll take them down," she finally said, pulling herself together. "And then-"\n\n"And then you will hide," he insisted, shooting a glance at the door. "Go! Hurry!"\n\nShe quickly grabbed her children and took them to the cellar. Both of them were scared, crying and just waiting for it to be over. It was only a few minutes of making sure they were situated before she realized she couldn't do it. She couldn't wait here for him to die. "Stay here," she told them, forcing a comforting smile. "I'll be right back."\n\nThe children only nodded, as she quickly returned up the stairs. Both children then heard muffled sounds above. Sounds of struggle, a gunshot, and a scream. Everything went silent, and as both children hid in the basement, the realization settled in.

The parade was magnificent, and Klyachkivsky had a small, but genuine smile as he looked out into the crowds.\n\nThis was a triumph only comparable to when they had first reclaimed Ukraine itself. Galicia was home, where she rightfully belonged.\n\nThe Poles had tried to fight, of course. They had attempted to stem the tide of Ukrainians pouring into Galicia, but they had wilted under the force that had been brought to bear. They could not stand against the sons of Ukraine, for they knew what they were fighting for was not their own.\n\nMeter by bloody meter, Galicia had been reclaimed, and the Poles who had once dominated it had fled or been dealt with.\n\nAs Galicia became soaked in the blood of Poles, they had finally conceded defeat once Ukraine had begun encroaching on Poland itself. Tempting as it might have been to end the Polish menace once and for all, Klyachkivsky was satisfied with Galicia. The Poles had been humiliated, broken, and would never trouble Ukraine again.\n\nHis legacy was now secured as the man who had first liberated Ukraine, and now had brought them victory in Galicia. Soon, he would be known as the man who would make Ukraine whole once more. The men who surrounded him were all smiles as he prepared to give his victory speech, and just for a moment Klyachkivsky basked in the adoration and euphoria as the crowds shouted his name.\n\nThis, he knew, was only the beginning."

He and his commanders stood around the table they had planned military operations before, and this time, the plans detailed an invasion of Hungary to reclaim the rightful Ukrainian lands they held. His commanders had been with him through it all; they were reliable when others had abandoned or betrayed him. There were few that he felt he could rely on - which made him surprised, disappointed, and concerned when they began raising their voices in dissent.\n\n"Vozhd, we've achieved victories that were said to be impossible," one of them said hesitantly, clearly nervous about speaking. "But we need to take care of our people now. The fighting left significant damage we need to rebuild. Once we do-"\n\nA single raised hand silenced the insubordinate officer. Klyachkivsky turned his cold eyes towards the wilting man. He let the silence hang ominously before he answered.\n\n"If we do it now, then there will not be another opportunity," Klyachkivsky reprimanded. "Anyone in possession of Ukrainian lands knows we will come to reclaim them. They will prepare, and more Ukrainian blood will be spent. We either strike now, or condemn more of Ukraine's sons to die later."\n\nThat authoritative statement was enough to silence any remaining dissent, if not completely. He would need to investigate this later. This kind of open defiance could prove troublesome once the wars were over. The conversation turned to more practical matters; troop positions, Hungarian defenses, and allocated resources.\n\nSo engrossed in the conversation, that none of them paid attention to the guards in the room. Not until the conversation abruptly stopped as they became aware of a gun that had been raised, aimed straight at the Vozhd's head."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.1.d: "Роман Шухевич вставив у ручку новий чорнильний картридж. Крізь штори просочувалося місячне світло. Він змерз і втомився. Схожий на привида, загорнутий у коротку синю ковдру, він перехилився через стіл і підтягнув лампу ближче, аж доки його обличчя не стало гарячим. Роман скинув черевики, витягнув ноги і вперше за сьогодні встав. Кілька хвилин він дивився на нотатки на столі. Він не міг прочитати написане. Було вже пізно - вітраж застилав йому очі.\n\nВін все ще пам'ятав, що записав. Його план був чітким у його голові: будувати з певного.\n\nБудувати з певного, тому що воно є основним. Думай, як мураха. Знищуй мельниківців і винагороджуй кооперативних партизанів. Руйнуй і будеш покараний, співпрацюй і будеш винагороджений. Україна зможе повернути собі Галичину лише після того, як це усвідомить. «Це додає, - пробурмотів Роман, - відчуття єдності. Давно такого не було».\n\nРоман обернувся, коли двері відчинилися. До нього тихо підкралася Наталя. «Романе, - прошепотіла вона, - я не кажу тобі не робити дурниць. Ти часто знаєш, що це дурниці. То чому ти ще не спиш?»\n\n«Це на завтра. Післязавтра. Я закінчую».\n\nВона посміхнулася. «Гаразд». Вона пройшла по підлозі, вщипнула його за вухо і не відпускала. «Ходи зі мною в ліжко, Романе».\n\nВона потягнула. Він не пручався. «Добре...»"

Поки безіменні істоти снували по дахах палацу, Шухевич і Позичанюк зачинили двері на засуви і усамітнилися в тихому натопленому передпокої. Повітропровід гудів.\n\nРоман затиснув чоло, розминаючи шкіру, наче тісто. Череп став м'яким. «Про республіканців, комуністів, - сказав він, - я не переплутаю наше послання. Не переплутаю. І я не хочу вести переговори». Він простягнув руки над повітропроводом і дозволив йому дихати теплим подихом на свої руки. «Чому ми повинні йти на компроміс з переможеною стороною? Ми не повинні. Я не бачу в цьому сенсу».\n\nВираз обличчя Романа був статичним, його риси були схожими на приколотих комах на картоні. «Що ми повинні робити, так це сприяти стабільності. Тому ми їх попереджаємо. Республіканців і комуністів. Якщо вони не здадуться, у нас є мандат на придушення. Якщо вони здадуться, не буде жодних проблем. Якщо ми зараз почнемо переговори, і вони проваляться, це буде виглядати як наша провина».\n\n«Все виглядає як наша провина», - сказав Йосип. «Ми кажемо, що ми сильна держава, то хто ж тоді винен, окрім нас? Якщо пограбували село, то це наша провина. "Чому мій уряд не може мене захистити?" - ось що запитають люди».\n\nЙосип схрестив руки і притиснув свій білий халат ближче до шкіри. «Якщо ми проведемо переговори, у нас буде можливість дати республіканцям і комуністам причину опустити зброю в осяжному майбутньому. Укласти щось зобов'язуюче, встановити умови для нового державного договору, який ми пишемо»."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.3.d: "У тьмяно освітленому підземному сховищі невелика група комуністичних повстанців сиділа за столом, плануючи свій наступний крок проти нового режиму. Це був один з останніх осередків комуністів, що зменшувався, і вони не знали, як діяти далі. Поки тривала дискусія, їхню увагу привернув потертий конверт, таємниче покладений на стіл. Лідер осередку, Максим, обережно взяв його і розглянув. Група зібралася навколо, коли Максим відкрив листа, їхня цікавість розпалилася.\n\nЛист був не від кого іншого, як від самого Шухевича, так званого "Вождя України". На їхнє здивування, він запропонував їм гарантію безпеки в обмін на припинення їхньої діяльності проти його уряду. Пропозиція спантеличила, і повстанці ретельно поставили під сумнів мотиви такої, здавалося б, пробачливої пропозиції. Вони дивувалися, чому, незважаючи на те, що уряд був цілком здатний знищити їх, він запропонував прощення? \n\nПісля тривалих дебатів група вирішила, що вони мало що втрачають, приймаючи пропозицію Шухевича. Вони вже давно зневірилися у своїй справі. Націоналісти добре і по-справжньому підкорили більшу частину їхньої опозиції. Перспектива нової комуністичної революції здавалася неможливою, майже всі лідери руху загинули, і тепер вони були загнані в кут. Максим написав їм відповідь, в якій погодився припинити свою діяльність, і повернув листа.\n\nДнями після цього вони з тривогою чекали на будь-яку відповідь або репресії, але їх не було. Коли їхня тривога вщухла і група адаптувалася в суспільстві, мотивація Вождя стала більш зрозумілою. Якщо Україна хоче встояти перед тим, що насувається, потрібно пробачити десятилітні образи. Немає потреби в ідеологічних чварах, коли Україна витріщається на німецького бегемота."

Їхні розмови були перервані, коли по радіо пролунав тріскучий голос самого Шухевича, звернений до всіх повстанців в Україні. Напруга в кімнаті була відчутною, коли вони слухали ультиматум.\n\n«Всім українцям, які були введені в оману, ми пропонуємо вам шанс на порятунок. Ваші лідери були розгромлені, і ви є нічим іншим, як скалкою в боці нації. Проте українцям не потрібно більше проливати українську кров. Іноземні держави прагнуть нас підкорити. На горизонті є набагато більш гідна боротьба. Негайно припиніть всі бойові дії. Ті, хто складуть зброю, будуть прощені.

Зрештою, багато хто з них вирішив здатися. Для них вільна Україна здавалася ще більш далекою, ніж будь-коли.

Саме мельниківський націоналіст привернув увагу Шухевича до цієї проблеми, гнівно увірвавшись до його кабінету з листом і праведним гнівом. Це здавалося таким буденним, таким несуттєвим, простий земельний спір.\n\nРік тому український фермер на галицькому кордоні продав два акра своєї ферми сусідові, чоловікові на чверть польського походження. Тепер фермер подав петицію до уряду, вимагаючи повної реституції землі, спираючись на своє чисте українське походження. Природно, що мельниківці побачили в цій земельній суперечці чергову велику українську расову боротьбу і стали на бік фермера.\n\nНе бажаючи займатися такими тривіальними справами, Шухевич покликав одного з небагатьох державних службовців, що залишилися в регіоні, для вирішення питання. Це була перша помилка. Чиновник виявився республіканцем і, що ще гірше, моралістом з кровоточивим серцем. Він вказав на те, що український фермер вже має величезні земельні ділянки і, крім того, йому заплатили законну плату за землю. Мельниківець у відповідь назвав республіканця жидом.\n\nЧерез годину здавалося, що вони вже навіть не обговорюють це питання, а просто стукають кулаками по столу, як неандертальці. Шухевич знав, що якщо це триватиме ще секунду, то або когось застрелять, або він впаде від аневризми. «Досить!» - крикнув він. Підвівся, дістав запальничку і, роздратовано зітхнувши, промовив. «Я піду на перекур, якщо ви двоє не прийдете до рішення, поки я повернуся, я приведу когось із комуністів, щоб він зробив це за вас».\n\nЧерез кілька хвилин, притулившись до дерев'яного стовпа, в голові Шухевича почала дрейфувати хмара дешевого тютюну.

Багато з них викликали у Лариси заздрість, адже все це виглядало дуже апетитно, і ніхто з її однокласників чи друзів не хотів ділитися. Він пообіцяв, що дасть це будь-якій дитині, яка принесе йому книжки, написані, за його словами, "дуже поганими людьми". Лариса трохи чула про те, про що він просив, і чесно кажучи, не впізнала жодного з імен або чому вони погані. Але через те, що сказав її батько, вона сумнівалася, що вони були настільки погані, як він стверджував. Вона вирішила, що він, напевно, бреше і нечесний, як і казав її батько.\n\nТа все ж таки, все це змусило її замислитися над тим, що ж таке ці нібито небезпечні книжки. Чи були звичайні слова насправді небезпечними або страшними? Якщо Цукеркар їх боявся, то, можливо, їй було б корисно дізнатися про це самій. Батько казав їй триматися подалі і не наражати себе на небезпеку, але зараз його тут не було.\n\nЦікавість взяла гору над батьківським авторитетом, особливо коли вона побачила можливість прямо перед собою, коли Цукеркар відволікся. Вона спостерігала за Цукеркаром здалеку і побачила, що у нього на лавці лежить стос книжок, а сам він намагається заманити дітей на ігровий майданчик. Вона швидко рушила вперед, схопила верхню книжку зі стопки і швидко побігла геть.\n\nСерце калатало від її захоплюючої пригоди, вона подивилася на книжку, яку взяла, і вона не здалася їй вражаючою. Вона глянула на назву - "Український націоналізм в..." Це була дуже довга назва, і написана вона кимось на ім'я Донцов. Що ж, можливо, це буде цікаво, і вона подивиться пізніше.\n\nВона тільки переконалася, що не скаже батькові, де вона її знайшла."

Войовничою силою з конкретною, ідеальною метою було легше керувати і контролювати. Бути лідером ніколи не було легко, але складні рішення мали менше шансів роз'ятрити рани або створити суспільні розколи.\n\nШухевич сидів за своїм столом, коли день згасав, обмірковуючи ситуацію, що стояла перед ним, і вибір, який треба було зробити. Були ті, хто підштовхував його до включення мельниківців в уряд, оскільки вони були б корисними в управлінні державою, покращили б стабільність нації.\n\nВони також були зрадниками.\n\nСаме цей факт робив рішення важким. Раніше це було б просте рішення, і зрадники були б прикладом для наслідування. Тепер все було не так просто. УПА більше не була в центрі уваги при прийнятті рішення. Тепер на першому місці була Україна, і це перетворило вибір з чорно-білого на темно-сірий.\n\nВін подивився на фотографію Коновальця на своїй полиці, ніби вона дала б йому рішення, яких йому зараз бракувало. Йому було цікаво, що б зробив Коновалець у цій ситуації? Чи зробив би він те, що було б необхідним для покращення стабільності нації? Чи усунув би зраду, де б вона не була виявлена? Він також гостро усвідомлював, що багато хто сприйме помилування зрадників погано, що може звести нанівець будь-яку стабільність, яка випливала з їхнього помилування.\n\nОдна річ була безсумнівною - деякі люди повинні були померти. Не бракувало тих, хто цього заслуговував. Питання було лише в тому, кого з них повісити."

Хоча багато з них діяли з прагматичних міркувань, керуючись бажанням вижити в умовах безвиході німецької окупації, їхні дії залишили на їхній репутації пляму, яку вже ніколи не змити.\n\nХоча вироки, винесені урядом Шухевича, часто були м'якими, особливо в порівнянні з більш суворим поводженням, з яким вони могли зіткнутися при уряді Клячківського, публічне таврування цих людей як колабораціоністів було найвищою мірою ганьбою. Імена винних були надруковані жирними літерами, що гарантувало, що їхні минулі гріхи переслідуватимуть їх до кінця життя. Проте вони були потрібні. Занадто багато українців співпрацювали, щоб усіх їх можна було стратити або відправити до трудових таборів, як це зробив би Клячківський. Новій бюрократії потрібен був досвід і знання, які мали ті, хто працював в адміністрації Райхскомісаріяту, принаймні на деякий час.\n\nНе дивлячись на більш поміркований підхід уряду Шухевича і його нетривалу співпрацю з нацистами, коли вони зіткнулися з радянською загрозою, мало хто був готовий співчувати колабораціоністам. Народ України надзвичайно постраждав під час нацистської окупації, і спогади про звірства, скоєні в той час, були ще свіжі в його пам'яті. Колаборанти зробили вибір..."

Через тісноту натовпу декому було важко розгледіти зведену шибеницю, але Онацький був задоволений тим, що бачив. Ніхто з присутніх не впізнав би його і не дізнався б, наскільки близько він був до того, щоб повіситися разом з ними.\n\nНе дивлячись на це, він давно чекав цього дня.\n\nВін знав момент, коли прибули троє чоловіків, оскільки звуки глузувань і знущань ставали все гучнішими, коли солдати розчищали шлях крізь натовп, проштовхуючи приречених вперед. Кожен з них виглядав змарнілим, нещасним і явно пережив усі радощі свого короткого тюремного ув'язнення.\n\nОнацький посміхався, коли їх підводили до шибениці, і дивився, як їм зав'язували петлі на шиях. Ніхто з них не намагався чинити опір. Сушко так важко дихав, що Онацький подумав, чи не розплачеться він. Сушко завжди був жалюгідним чоловіком, коли його позбавляли образу сильного чоловіка, за яким він ховався.\n\nБуло зачитано їхні злочини, а також вирок: смерть через повішення, що викликало вимогливе вигукування натовпу. Тіла падали одне за одним, а петля затягувалася. Кожне з тіл борсалося кілька секунд, перш ніж заклякло, залишаючи шиї викривленими під неправильним кутом.\n\nКоли кожна людина помирала, натовп вигукував своє схвалення, а очі Онацького виказували явне задоволення, і його серце палало від помсти, коли його ненависні колеги зустріли кінець, на який вони так заслуговували."

Безмежно відданий справі, але у спосіб, який був явно його власним.\n\nЙого було важко прочитати; незбагненний таким чином, що це робило його гіршим за когось на кшталт Сушка, чиї мотивації були зрозумілими. Шухевичу не треба було переконувати інших у своєму авторитеті, як Сушку; він природно привертав до себе увагу.\n\nБільшу частину зустрічі вони провели, обговорюючи, як вони зможуть підтримати уряд Шухевича - дуже наполегливо заявляючи про свою лояльність і згоду з керівництвом його держави. Обидва чоловіки знали, що єдиною причиною, чому їх не повісили, було те, що Шухевич вважав їх і решту мельниківців корисними.\n\nЯкби він відчув, що вони якимось чином заважають, або, що ще гірше, нелояльні, Онацький повністю вірив, що це зміниться.\n\nПриватним чином обидва чоловіки мали певні застереження щодо коаліції Шухевича. Сам він погоджувався з ними у більшості питань, хоча люди навколо нього були... не ідеальними. Зокрема, Позичанюк був прихованим лібералом, і все ж Шухевич, схоже, вважав його близьким союзником, якщо не другом.\n\nНезважаючи на цей розрив, це було найкраще, що кожен з них міг отримати, і Онацький волів би залишитися на землі живих, служачи Україні якнайкраще, ніж бути веденим на шибеницю через незгоду з наймогутнішою людиною в Україні. Ні, так було найкраще для всіх учасників. Він лише сподівався, що Шухевич погодиться. Нарешті, коли вони закінчили, чоловік кілька секунд мовчав, перш ніж кивнути головою."

З Шухевичем було кілька документів і карт, що детально описували передбачуване вторгнення в регіон.\n\nЗустріч розпочалася досить нормально, більшість запитань надходила від Кука. Обидва вони обговорювали деякі деталі, хоча Кук, здавалося, був задоволений планом. На відміну від нього, Позичанюк здебільшого мовчав, і на його обличчі був стурбований вираз. Нарешті він заговорив. «Це справді найкращий підхід? Атакувати без попередження і вагань?»\n\nКук насупився, хоча Шухевич стояв перед ним просто обличчям до обличчя. «Ви не згодні?»\n\n«Я не згодний з тим, щоб втягнути нас у ще одну війну без спроб переговорів», - пояснив Позичанюк. «Поляки не дурні - вони знають, що програють війну проти нас, тож чи можуть вони добровільно віддати Галичину? Хіба це не краще, ніж гарантувати війну?»\n\n«А що, якщо вони використають цей час, щоб закріпитися?» - запитав Кук. «Це тільки зробить війну кривавішою».\n\nПозичанюк відповів не одразу, але не відводив погляду від Шухевича. «То нехай буде так. Краще ми зробимо спробу, ніж почнемо війну заради неї».\n\nОбидва чоловіки чекали на його рішення, і їхнього лідера, як завжди, було важко прочитати. Ні вираз його обличчя, ні очі не видавали того, що він справді відчував.

Вечеря, яку Наталя приготувала на цей вечір, як завжди, була чудовою, а дискусія, як завжди, точилася навколо дітей, до якої він напівслухав, хоча національні проблеми залишалися на задвірках його свідомості.\n\n«Тату?»\n\nЙого швидко повернув до життя голос дочки, і він побачив Марію, яка вичікувально дивилася на нього, перш ніж зітхнути з перебільшеним почуттям провини. «Думаю, тобі треба ще трохи відпочити. А то так і задрімаєш».\n\nНаталя злегка посміхнулася, а Шухевич лише підняв брову, задовольнившись тим, що розмова пішла далі. Юрій насупився. «Припини. Він зараз працює більше, ніж будь-хто.

Війна з Польщею нависла над країною, і ніхто не уникне її пекла.\n\nТа все ж вони намагалися насолодитися їжею, яку з любов'ю приготувала для них Наталя. Шухевич намагався зробити свій внесок і відвернути країну від майбутньої війни. Намір, який раптово був підірваний, коли Юрій втрутився під час затишшя.\n\n«Я збираюся піти добровольцем на фронт». Він глибоко зітхнув. «Прийшов мій час це зробити».\n\nНегайною реакцією було здивування і жах.

Ти ще не достатньо дорослий!»\n\n«Є чоловіки молодші за мене, які вже воювали», - сказав Юрій спокійним голосом. «Я провів достатньо часу на тренуваннях».\n\n«Але, - сказала Марія тихим голосом. «Ти можеш загинути».\n\nЮрій повільно кивнув. «Я міг би. Але так само міг би кожен інший чоловік, який воює. Чому я маю бути особливим тільки через свого батька?»\n\n«Твій батько скаже те ж саме», - благально звернулася до нього Наталя. «Ти ще не готовий.

У нас немає медикаментів і майже немає бинтів. Вдаємося до листя. Воно допомагає, принаймні на деякий час».\n\nЮрію нарешті вдалося вийти з намету, але не раніше, ніж він зустрівся з кількома чоловіками. Йому довелося відтягнути їх від камери, всі вони благали його не публікувати фотографії. Юрій пообіцяв, що не допустить цього, але пізніше, дивлячись на безхмарне небо, яке так відрізнялося від того, що відбувалося внизу, замислився: чи варто було це робити?"

Пагорби вдалині мали чіткі сліди польових робіт на них, а на вершині червоно-білий польський прапор тріпотів під легким вітерцем.\n\nНе повинно було бути так, як сталося. Війна не повинна була стати повторенням попередніх польсько-українських воєн, ні. Вона мала бути змодельована за зразком оригінальних німецьких наступальних операцій, з швидкими ударами, що розгромлять і оточать дезорганізовані польські формування, і швидкою перемогою, що послідує за ними. Принаймні, так планував штаб. Очевидно, ніхто не думав, що поляки можуть не погодитися з цим баченням.\n\nКомандувач пам'ятав, як швидко ці початкові атаки були відкинуті вбік. Як швидко вони були притуплені. Як швидко все повернулося до того, що є зараз, до запеклих боїв проти рішучої і укоріненої опозиції. Повільне просування вперед оплачується великою кількістю крові. Це, безсумнівно, була одна з них.\n\nКомандир відвернувся від проклятого прапора і попрямував назад на свій пост. Оборона була грізною, і потрібно було визначити, скільки людей послати вперед, послати на смерть, щоб мати хороші шанси на взяття фортеці. Відповідь, безсумнівно, була надто дорогою.\n\nАле все одно треба було заплатити за це."

У сільській місцевості спалено сорок три селянські садиби, здійснено напади на три застави та вбито два патрулі».\n\nГоловний командир українських військових сил у Галичині виголошував свою доповідь нервовим монотоном, тоді як решта українського генерального штабу, і, головне, Роман Шухевич, дивилися на нього з острахом. Він прочистив горло втретє за кілька хвилин і продовжив.\n\n«Їхні можливості загалом здаються невеликими, проте, безумовно, допомогу їм надають їхні союзники по той бік кордону. Вони користуються великою повагою серед місцевих поляків, але глибоко зневажаються нашим народом. Спроби порушити лінії постачання були помірно успішними, але вони залишаються проблемою в прикордонних регіонах».\n\nКомандир нарешті закінчив свою доповідь і незграбно встав, чекаючи на запитання. Роман Шухевич посидів, очевидно, в глибокій задумі, а потім повільно підвівся. Він дивився прямо на командира, який ледве зустрічався з ним поглядом, хоча стояв на відстані цілого столу.\n\n«Для мене питання здається зрозумілим. У Галичині є поляки. Це центральна проблема, яку треба вирішити. Ніяка контрповстанська боротьба не спрацює, коли у вас є п'ята колона, яка постійно працює на підтримку наших ворогів. Ми не маємо ні коштів, ні браку самоповаги, щоб підкуповувати їх дрібничками. Бандера чітко сказав: всі поляки повинні померти або бути вигнані. Це і є рішення. Я очікую, що солдати будуть віддані цьому завданню, як тільки ми вийдемо з цієї кімнати»."

Він згадав, як роками дивився вниз на це село, але так і не зміг побачити його. Батько казав, що він зможе відвідати його, коли Галичина буде звільнена. Коли він піднімався на пагорб, його очікування зростали і переростали у всілякі фантазії.\n\nЗа пагорбом нічого не було.\n\nВсе, що залишилося від села - це обвуглена церква.

Шухевич був у помітному доброму настрої, оскільки він, Кук і Позичанюк також брали участь у святкуваннях, в одному з таких зібрань з солдатами, громадянами та офіцерами.\n\nШухевич був цілком задоволений завершенням війни. Саме звільнення Галичини не викликало сумнівів, але було питання, наскільки високою буде ціна. Як сильно поляки окопаються? Наскільки добре його солдати зможуть виконати свої плани? Кожна відповідь була рішуче на їхню користь.\n\n«Перемога заслужена, Романе», - похвалив Кук з посмішкою, потягуючи свій напій. «І все це майже без крові. Я, чесно кажучи, здивований; я очікував, що поляки чинитимуть більший опір».\n\n«Так, я теж», - роздумував Шухевич, спостерігаючи за жвавим натовпом. «Можливо, вони не хотіли жертвувати своїми людьми у війні, яку вони знали, що програють. Результат все одно однаковий. Галичина наша». «Віднині і назавжди», - підняв келих Кук. «Слава Україні».\n\nШухевич усміхнувся у відповідь. «Героям слава».\n\nЄдиним із присутніх, чий настрій не збігався з рештою, був Позичанюк, який не міг позбутися думки, що все можна було б вирішити без пострілів.

Він нагадував Позичанюку згорнуту змію, вовка, який оцінює здобич, і він знав, чому. Бої в Галичині тривали вже кілька днів. Вони йшли не дуже добре. Шухевич розгорнув на столі карту з позначками. «Укріплення», - одним словом відкрив її Шухевич. «Кожне з них розташоване на критичних перехрестях і зведене протягом останніх кількох тижнів.

Їхнє бажання утримати Галичину є очевидним».\n\nКук стиснув губи, і здавалося, що він намагається не дивитися на Посичанюка, який залишався дуже тихим. Було зрозуміло, що Шухевич не збирається згадувати про те, що рішення про раптове вторгнення призвело до цього... поки що ні. Водночас усі знали, що до цього призвело.\n\nПорада Кука виявилася згубною.

The noises were beginning to fade, the air beginning to cool, and the light slowly retreating.\n\nHe stiffened his spine, hardened his heart, and set his eyes firmly towards the descending Ukrainian sun. The feelings of joy and triumph had slowly faded and been replaced by a bitter, cold understanding of what would come next. Would Ukraine look to their new leader with the reverence and respect owed? Would they have the stomach for the cleansing that had to take place.\n\nHe was skeptical. He knew how quickly adoration and love could turn to festering hatred. Men were fickle, and few had the spine and will to make the hard decisions necessary for the preservation of the nation.\n\nFortunately, he needed not their love or adoration. He did not need them at all.\n\nThe coming days were going to be difficult. He would face smears, lies, and knives from friend and enemy alike. The former driven by ambition or conscience, the latter by hatred of what he intended to do, or jealousy of what he had achieved despite all odds.\n\nYet he was who Ukraine needed at this juncture of history. Just as Ukraine had needed Ivan Mazepa, they would also need Yaroslav Stetsko. And like Mazepa, they would do everything they could to depose him - a fate he would not suffer. He could not fail. He could not be stopped now. No one else had the will to carry out his vision.\n\nNo, he knew what would come, and what he had to do.

Stetsko had made sure that no expense - what little there was - was spared to make the men from Germania feel comfortable.\n\nToday would be very important, there could be no mistakes.\n\nTo his surprise, many of them had been enthusiastic when he'd reached out to them. Within days no fewer than a dozen representatives from industrial and chemical corporations had accepted his offer to present them with his future of Ukraine within the Einheitspakt. Their reaction in-person had been just as enthusiastic, and they expressed interest in what he had to show them.\n\nOnce all of them were seated, and opened with a heil to the Führer, Stetsko began his pitch. "Thank you all for your attendance and attention. I believe there is a bright future between Ukraine and the Reich, with many opportunities for those who pay attention. I will be outlining this future to you - and how each of you can ensure that it not only succeeds, but prospers beyond all expectations."\n\nThe businessmen listened attentively, giving him - or his plans at least - their full attention. Stetsko was rather pleased at the attention - not for a moment was their attention divided. At times it seemed they were more focused on the spreadsheets and numbers - but they were businessmen. Such was to be expected, and once they saw the profit projections, he knew he had them.\n\nIt gave him a renewed sense of optimism about how this would go. If the businessmen were treating him as a proper head of state, that could only portend good things before the leadership of the Reich paid attention."

BOV_stetsko_peace.3.t: "Belated Revelations"
BOV_stetsko_peace.3.d: "Dmytro Maivsky was not one to ignore what was in front of him, and he could not deny the creeping feelings of dread that had grown since Stetsko's ascension.\n\nAnd what he'd seen, and continued to see, unsettled him.\n\nCompared to whom had come before, Stetsko was a necessary change of leadership. Everyone agreed it was necessary, and between those who could possibly fill the role, he fit the bill the best - especially if the only alternative had been Roman. Maivsky had no regrets about supporting him, and ensuring his victory against Klyachkivsky.\n\nHowever, the extent to which Stetsko had relished in the elimination of everyone who had come before concerned him. It wasn't his retribution against Klyachkivsky and his sycophants - it was his actions against anyone who had tangentially been connected to the man's clique, as well as some who hadn't. Considering that all of them had served under Klyachkivsky for many years, Maivsky had some tolerance for integrating some of the less important loyalists. People could change, or not realize there were other options.\n\nStetsko apparently had no such understanding or mercy.\n\nHis actions alone were questionable, but there were other signs that Stetsko's ambitions were not necessarily the best for Ukraine. His violence, paranoia, and dogma, all were reminiscent of the man they had just removed in worrying ways. He didn't like the idea that they had replaced one madman for another-\n\nHe had no more time to ponder on this revelation before the sound of a gun sounded, glass shattered less than a second later, both sounds he barely had time to react to before it was too late. Bullets rent into flesh and send him careening to the ground."
BOV_stetsko_peace.3.a: "He hadn't even had time to feel pain."

BOV_stetsko_peace.4.t: "Covered by the Fire"
BOV_stetsko_peace.4.d: "The falling of the sun portended the coming violence.\n\nThe tensions in the small town had been escalating for weeks now. Maxim had been dreading the moment when everything was going to snap, and he could only fear what would happen next. Nothing good, he knew that much. The most intolerant of the Ukrainians had become bolder and more viscous towards anyone Russian since the UPA had taken over.\n\nThere had been some solidarity between them as fellow men persecuted under German domination. A solidarity which had dissipated; any good Ukrainians had been silenced, driven out, or were now just showing their true colors. It didn't matter - Russians were no longer brethren, but vermin to be exterminated at the urging of their Vozhd.\n\nDarkness fell, and the violence began.\n\nThere had been clashes before; sporadic attacks against isolated Russians. This time the bands were in the dozens, and no longer were their faces hidden. Maxim heard the sounds of glass breaking, the screams of victims, and smelled the smoke. The entire Russian part of the town was burning, and he quickly made to leave.\n\nThere was no time to think, if he stayed he was going to die. The fire, smoke, and roars of the euphoric rioters gave him cover to escape his home unnoticed before the Ukrainians descended. Maxim paused for just a moment as he kept to the edges of the streets, recognizing one of the men in the crowds - a police officer he'd seen earlier in the day.\n\nHe kept his head down, and kept moving, and didn't look back as he said goodbye to the only home he'd known. A home he'd never return to."
BOV_stetsko_peace.4.a: "Ukraine was no longer safe for Russians."

BOV_stetsko_peace.5.t: "Strange Days in Ukraine"
BOV_stetsko_peace.5.d: "Every German settler lived in a constant state of stress and fear since the Ukrainian takeover. Kilian was no exception, but unlike other settlers, he was part of a local militia - a small comfort in times like this. Not that it would stop much if the Ukrainians decided to act.\n\nThe days were long, and like they were waiting for their executions. Fortunately, nothing had happened to them - yet. Part of him wondered at why, but a larger part of him was relieved. His wife had suggested that the Ukrainians knew that attacking Germans would ensure their erasure by the Reich, but Kilian was not convinced.\n\nIf fear of German retaliation was driving their decisions, then they wouldn't have rebelled in the first place, and remained in their place. Instead they'd rebelled, overthrown the rightful government, and now his family could only hope to live another day.\n\nToday might be their last.\n\nHe'd woken to the sounds of cars driving through the streets, each filled with Ukrainian soldiers. He'd wiped his bleary eyes, and instinctively suited to potentially fight. Was it an attack? An invasion? He grabbed his gun, feeling isolated and afraid. His breath came in short bursts, and his knuckles were white.\n\n"Kilian, look!" His wife burst in, a piece of paper in her hand. Exhaling, he quickly took the paper, and read it, growing confused. The Ukrainians were indeed here - but according to the notice, they were here to protect them. From who? Other Ukrainians?\n\nHe met his wife's eyes, and saw the same question and confusion echoed in them. Both of them near the window, they watched more trucks conduct their patrols. It took a few minutes before they started to relax, pondering on this strange turn of events."
BOV_stetsko_peace.5.a: "Perhaps things may be turning around."

BOV_stetsko_peace.6.t: "A New Opening"
BOV_stetsko_peace.6.d: "There was one thing that Stetsko looked forward to at the end of each day. No matter the drudgery or stress of work, there was without reservation one bright spot. A smile, hug, and kiss from his wife when he returned seemed to make the worries of the day fade. No matter what happened, there was always one person who truly understood and loved him without reservation.\n\nThey sat around a small table, eating one of her excellent meals. Stetsko made sure to savor it - Slava could truly cook like no one else. "Work was good?" Slava Stetsko asked as they ate, a questioning look in her eyes.\n\nToday, he was in a good mood for reasons beyond spending time with his wife. He'd been looking forward to sharing the news since he'd left work. It'd taken some time to get things arranged - but it would be worth it for this moment. "Yes. I have some news. We've made the decision to establish some critical roles that need to be filled..."\n\nHe let the sentence hang briefly. "Particularly in the Publications Department. It just so happens we're in need of a lead editor," a teasing note entered his voice. "You wouldn't happen to know one, would you?"\n\nShe paused, the fork halfway to her mouth, quickly grasping what he was saying. Then a wide smile crossed her face. "Well...Are you making me an offer, Mr. Stetsko?"\n\nHe returned the warm smile with a proud one of his own. "I can't think of anyone more suited. It is yours - should you be interested." He only needed to look into her eyes to see her happiness, and the answer she would give.\n\n"I wouldn't have it another way," she told him. "When do I start?""
BOV_stetsko_peace.6.a: "From that point on, both of their days would be a little brighter."

BOV_stetsko_peace.7.t: "One for Another"
BOV_stetsko_peace.7.d: "Once the doors had been smashed open, Yakiv knew it was over. They'd all hoped that their printing operation would remain hidden from the eyes of the UPA, but it had been a naive hope. A few of them had already gone into hiding, but the rest had stuck together and tried to dispose of the evidence of their work.\n\nAll of them expected only one fate for collaborators, especially ones who'd worked under the direction of the Reichskommissariat. However, they must have been followed, because they'd barely been able to start burning the pamphlets and papers before the doors had been smashed open.\n\nThe soldiers had not been gentle, grabbing and shoving them outside, and cordining them off to the side of the building at gunpoint. Several soldiers with engineering equipment entered, who Yakiv knew would be taking apart their printing press.\n\nThey were approached by the sergeant leading the soldiers, a tall and square-faced man who appraised the group. Yakiv wondered if they'd be shot then and there. Instead, the man made a gesture, and weapons were lowered. "You worked for the Germans, correct?"\n\nLying was pointless, so they all nodded; some of them flinching. The sergeant nodded once. "I am going to give you two choices - you work for us now, without question or complaint, and you'll keep your printing operation. Or we put you down here and now." An ugly smile crossed his face. "No one will bat an eye at the deaths of some collaborators."\n\nYakiv looked at his friends, trying to hide his fear and relief. They'd exchanged one master for another - but at least now they could live. If the UPA wanted them to print propaganda? They'd do that. One by one, each of them nodded, and with a smile, the sergeant waved off the guards."
BOV_stetsko_peace.7.a: "Don't stand there gawking - you have work to do!"

BOV_stetsko_peace.8.t: "Let Loose the Dogs"
BOV_stetsko_peace.8.d: "Stetsko stood before the legions of uniformed soldiers; thousands who had been assembled during a cool Ukrainian morning. The first rays of the sun began to spread behind him as he appraised over his army with pride and euphoria.\n\nSo little could compare to this feeling. The power to command armies, and change the course of nations. The power of the man who had saved Ukraine, who had brought purity to it - and who would now make it whole. Today, in the hearts of man and woman, soldier and civilian, they would understand the momentous occasion this was.\n\nHe began his speech with history; a story of a time when Ukraine was whole, before the Poles had stolen their rightful lands of Lviv and Galicia. He painted a picture of their beautiful cities, their colorful fields, and their irreplaceable value to Ukraine as a nation and people. He spoke of their brethren who lived and toiled under Polish rule. Raucous emotion rang through his nasally voice, and many who watched were struck by his inharmonious eloquence.\n\nEventually, Stetsko had set the stage - now it was time to draw the sword. "No more will we allow our cities and lands of Ukrainian history and beauty be held by foreign thieves," Stetsko declared. "No more will our people - brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers - remain under Polish domination. No more will Ukraine remain divided!"\n\nHe repeated it once more, his voice suddenly quiet; intense. "No more."\n\nHe stood as straight as he could make himself, his voice projected as far as it would go. "Today, Ukraine marches to liberate her people! Today, Ukraine reclaims her rightful lands! Today, Ukraine becomes whole!" He ended with a shout, and was answered with a roar that lasted for minutes while Stetsko basked in the noise, a wide smile on his face."
BOV_stetsko_peace.8.a: "The hounds of war howled for release, and in his hands was the leash."

BOV_stetsko_peace.9.t: "Lviv Burns"
BOV_stetsko_peace.9.d: "The ground shook and Urban Tokarczyk peered fearfully outside of his window as the shelling ground to a halt. The Home Army had been driven from the city, and Ukrainian forces ruled the streets. His family had tried to run, but the Ukrainians had surrounded the city before they could get far. Now, they hid in their home and prayed.\n\nHis eyes narrowed as soldiers in dark uniforms kicked in their neighbor's door. At first, he thought they meant to loot the house. A piercing scream and automatic weapons fire put a stop to that delusion. When the men left the house and repeated these actions at the next, he realized their goal. They meant to kill them all. To finish what the Nazi's had started.\n\nLaura! he shouted at his wife in the next room. You must hide! he ordered.\n\nUrban heard his wife usher their daughter into the small crawl space that led to the foundation of their home. Once they had used it to hide weapons for the Home Army, now they had to hide from those they may have considered friends.\n\nUrban did not join his family. He could not. Instead, he went into the small bedroom he shared with his beloved Laura and unlocked the trunk in the closet. From within he pulled the burnished steel of a Błyskawica submachine gun. Laura and Celina would be better served with a distraction. His hands shook as he loaded the weapon.\n\nWith the sound of slaughter to motivate him, he forced the back door open and shouted until his throat burned. When the front door was kicked open, he opened fire without hesitation. Under the floorboards, his family despaired as his body hit the ground with a thud."
BOV_stetsko_peace.9.a: "Sacrifice, without hesitance."

BOV_stetsko_peace.10.t: "A Triumph to Savor"
BOV_stetsko_peace.10.d: "Victory. A feeling to savor and celebrate.\n\nStetsko walked between the ranks of cheering and saluting soldiers as he climbed the podium to deliver his triumph to Ukraine - and the world. As he had expected, the Ukrainians had swiftly destroyed the Poles who had dared try and hold their stolen Ukrainian lands.\n\nAnd each one had paid the ultimate price for their crimes.\n\n"Today, Ukraine is whole!" He began loudly, which was instantly answered by the cheers of his soldiers. He only continued when the noise had lessened. "The brave sons of Ukraine have shown the world their might, and revealed the weakness and degeneracy of the enemy who thought he could keep Ukrainians subordinate!"\n\nEach conclusion was punctuated by brief cheers of approval. "The world will remember this day," Stetsko continued. "History will know that at every moment, our men showed bravery and courage, and sent the sniveling Poles into retreat! Today was a triumph not just over a dead nation, but for all Ukrainians over the Poles who sought to subjugate us."\n\nStetsko smiled widely. "Now they have been beaten, humiliated, and destroyed. They will remember this day, and tremble as they understand that they live only because we allowed it - and should they dare test us, we will march on Warsaw, and finish what we started!"\n\nHis words were drowned out by the baying roars of the soldiers; the men who'd liberated their lands from the enemy. Stetsko today felt only victory and triumph; one he was certain the world was watching. It was a promising sign of things to come."
BOV_stetsko_peace.10.a: "One victory will surely bring many others."

BOV_stetsko_peace.11.t: "Consequences"
BOV_stetsko_peace.11.d: "Tired eyes read the report in front of them for what felt like the thousandth time. The front line was stalling. The Poles proved to be a tougher nut to crack than he had ever hoped. Even now, their forces fought outside Lviv and on the road to Warsaw. Even in Lviv itself and other regions in the countryside, report after report of partisan activity flooded onto his desk. The Polish flame refused to bend to the inevitable wind of the Ukrainian state, and it galled Stetsko to no end.\n\nHis generals sent him good tidings, and yet their advances continued to stall. Yaroslav leaned back in his chair and rested his head in his hands. Every day a new request for more resources would come in, and every day little to no progress was made. Even as the supposedly necessary weapons, vehicles, and more rolled out to the front.\n\nHe let out a long suffering sigh and adjusted himself in the chair. Were there no competent generals in the army? Had there ever been? With no small amount of spite, he remembered some of his old comrades in the OUN. Most were dead now, on his orders. Those snakes in the grass, the false shepherds and Judas', deserved their fate, of that there could be no doubt. Yet, at the back of his mind, he could not help but feel the smallest tinge of regret. Not for his actions, to be sure, but the lack of foresight to ensure competent replacements.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, if they could understand my genius they could have survived. With a derisive shake of his head, he stood and walked out of the room. He was tired, and his wife was undoubtedly waiting for him. The bumbling of his generals could wait until morning"
BOV_stetsko_peace.11.a: "Foresight is the province of better men."

BOV_stetsko_peace.12.t: "Mud and Blood"
BOV_stetsko_peace.12.d: "Rain poured from the skies of Poland as if all the hosts of heaven were in mourning. The trenchwork below Artem's feet was a sodden mess of sucking mud and corpses. A polish mortar had landed directly in the middle of his detachment, and now he was all that remained.\n\nEven as bullets whizzed above his head, Artem Semenovych Denysenko cursed one man to all the circles of hell. The ever glorious leader of Ukraine, Yaroslav Stetsko. The so-called Last hope for a free Ukraine, what a joke.\n\nArtem had grown up under the Nazi boot. His father was murdered for talking back to a German official, his mother died of pneumonia that would have been treated if she was allowed into a hospital. He had survived hell in the camps and the plantations. When the Reichskommissariat fell apart, he had fought with his friends and countrymen to bring about a free Ukraine.\n\nIt was so easy, then, to be blinded by hate for the communists and the liberals. It had been so easy to join the fight against the Poles, they were squatting on Ukrainian land, after all. Artem scoffed, what a fool he was.\n\nHis eyes found the bodies of his squad. He had been transferred after Lviv, and his new squadmates were little more than boys. Fresh faced, yet already robbed of their innocence by years under a foreign boot.\n\nHow many on the other side of the trench wall were the same? How many of those boys had seen their families murdered by Germans and Ukrainians both?\n\nArtem looked into the gray skies and he blinked the rain out of his eyes. He heard the mortar whistling through the air, and he knew in his heart of hearts that it had his name on it. With eyes closed and a small smile, Artem accepted his fate."
BOV_stetsko_peace.12.a: "He would wait for Stetsko in hell."

BOV_stetsko_peace.13.t: "Grim Faces, Hollow Eyes"
BOV_stetsko_peace.13.d: "Stetsko had not reached the heights he now enjoyed without knowing how to read people, and understood where they stood, or how they'd react. Today the mood he sensed from the soldiers and civilians, all who gathered for his victory speech in Galicia was not exactly one of victory, but instead of weariness.\n\nThe war was over, they had won, but it had certainly not been the quick victory they had anticipated. The Poles had put up a fierce resistance, and they had suffered grievous losses before their victory. The land they stood in today had been paid for in the blood of many of Ukraine's sons.\n\nNo amount of words could change that fact. Stetsko planned to attempt a different approach today, a more somber and moderate tone. "My friends, soldiers, and all people of Ukraine, today we celebrate our triumph - and honor the ultimate sacrifice so many made."\n\nThe faces he looked out upon were grim; matching the solemn atmosphere. "There is nothing that can replace the brave men who died in service of their nation - but there is no higher sacrifice one can give. Each man who fell in battle will be remembered as a hero of Ukraine. Let it be clear that their sacrifice has ensured our inevitable triumph."\n\nHe kept talking, but it sounded hollow; the ambitions he had built so carefully were starting to show cracks. Still, he had to press on. "Ukraine is whole once again, and because of this, we can begin working towards the future. Our greatness is yet to come, and because of the sacrifice of so many brave men - we will achieve it soon."\n\nThe people applauded as he finished, but it was moderated; polite. The smiles didn't reach their eyes, nor did the cheers carry vigor. Something uneasy built in Stetsko's stomach, and a sense of foreboding descended."
BOV_stetsko_peace.13.a: "And a fear that the spell had permanently broken."

BOV_stetsko_peace.14.t: "Circling Vultures"
BOV_stetsko_peace.14.d: "Some days Stetsko wondered if he was trapped in a nightmare, but as he awoke each day, it was impossible to escape the fact that things were bad, and could become much worse.\n\nThere was not a day that went by without him hearing of some new resistance against him. Entire units disappearing from patrols. Assassinations of officials or officers. Protests from emboldened citizens demanding answers and 'justice.' Which was to say nothing of the pervasive rumors about his own people plotting behind his back.\n\nMedia that had once been friendly now regularly attacked him. Bodyguards had become a necessity, and he had started rotating them randomly out of a concern that not even they could be trusted. All because of the Galician disaster.\n\nAt worst he had expected the costs to be high. He'd decided to maintain the offensive because as long as they reclaimed Galicia, he could make it work. Yet as the bodies had returned in greater numbers, the frontlines stalled, and the Poles held firm, he had been forced to do the unthinkable.\n\nAdmit defeat. Admit that it had all been for nothing.\n\nWhat did he have to show for the campaign outside of thousands of Ukrainian men dead? Nothing. He had been humiliated and his image destroyed. His allies, cabinet, and generals didn't matter, because he was the face of Ukraine. And now he couldn't move aggressively because there were too many traitors and opportunities who had the knives out.\n\nHe had to just stay alive and on top of the situation for a little while, and things would calm down, and he could figure something out. He was certain he could at least do that - even if it would be difficult."
BOV_stetsko_peace.14.a: "At least it couldn't get much worse."

BOV_stetsko_peace.15.t: "An Untimely Escape"
BOV_stetsko_peace.15.d: "Lebed's face was grim, and that was never something that portended good news. Stetsko had made sure his office was clear, and the two men could speak openly. "He's gone," Lebed said without any preamble. "Pozychanyuk is gone."\n\nStetsko resisted a hiss of frustration at the news of one of Shukhevych's rats escaping their well-deserved fate. "How? Do you have an idea of where he went?"\n\n"Unknown, men are searching as we speak, but..." Lebed paused. "That 'how' is the question. He was just gone when the guards did a routine check. There was no sign of a forced exit, no unlocked doors, no witnesses, nothing. It's like he let himself out."\n\nStetsko's eyebrows furrowed. "We both know that's impossible."\n\n"On his own, I agree," Lebed grimaced. "It seems almost certain that he had help. Only a few people would be able to arrange for something like this. People with authority."\n\nStetsko appraised Lebed closely, picking up the insinuation. "If you are going to make accusations," he said slowly. "Speak carefully."\n\nLebed frowned, seeming to be taken aback. "I will narrow suspects down shortly, but we need to consider that the traitor could be high in the government. And we need to find them now."\n\nStetsko tried to think of who could betray him now - and came up empty. No, everyone was committed and loyal, and Lebed was suggesting they might be traitors? "Conduct your investigation," he said. "But do not accuse the people most loyal to us of treason. Get Pozychanyuk back. That's your priority." Lebed did not seem fully happy, but he did not risk speaking further. He simply nodded and saluted."
