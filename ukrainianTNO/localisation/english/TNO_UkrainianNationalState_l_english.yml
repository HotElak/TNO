 BOV_Dmytro_Klyachkivsky: "Дмитро Клячківський"

 POLITICS_DMYTRO_KLYACHKIVSKY_DESC: "Вірність. Доблесть. Жертовність. Цінності, які Степан Бандера вважав необхідними для свободи, а Дмитро Клячківський палко наслідував. З волі Бандери він очистив Галичину і Волинь від виродків, що плямували українську землю. Коли вождь Коновалець піддався хворобі, вони згуртували народ проти архізрадника Мельника, який вклонявся німцям, поки ті грабували Україну.\n\nВідданість. Доблесть. Жертовність. Цінності, які давно вже було втрачено. Клячківський узявся за бандерове стерно, очоливши Українську повстанську армію. Перша битва була кривавою, і багато людей полягло від гніву німецької сталі. У той час як справжні революціонери продовжували боротися, слабкодухі дезертирували. Друга битва була успішною, поки не повернулися безхребетні дворняги, які служили райхскомісару за недоїдки, а дехто навіть перейшов до республіканізму. Орди зрадників перемогли їх, і Клячківський помститься.\n\nВідданість. Доблесть. Жертовність. Цінності, які необхідно відновити. Український народ знемагає в кайданах, які скували йому зрадники та їхні іноземні господарі. Врятувати його може лише справжня сила, не декаденти-ліберали, не соціалісти-євреї і не іноземні таргани. Усі вони - хвороба, яку треба викорінити, отруйна зараза, яку можна очистити лише в полум'ї бою. Україна не буде вільною, поки не буде виконана воля Бандери."
 POLITICS_ROMAN_SHUKHEVYCH_DESC: "Роман Шухевич, Тур, Тарас Чупринка - все це імена людини, яку переслідує його минуле. Він був українським золотим хлопчиком для німців, хоч і омитим кров'ю. Він був офіцером батальйонів «Нахтіґаль». Він був гауптманом 201-го батальйону шуцманшафту, що брав участь у вбивстві поляків під час трагічних подій на Галичині та Волині. Нагородою за такі «антипартизанські заходи» стала зрада з боку німців і зміцнення їхньої влади над Україною.\n\nТакою є його історія, він, може, і не пишається нею, але вона є частиною його самого. Для Шухевича примирити своє минуле людини, що співпрацювала з німцями, і теперішнє як борця опору дуже просто. Мотиви, які пов'язували ці два життя, не змінилися - кожен його вчинок був спрямований на світлу Україну. Саме за теперішнє і майбутнє він бореться. Очищення кліки Клячківського і Стецька було необхідним, адже вони вже відштовхнули від себе стільки потенційних союзників у боротьбі з Німеччиною. Дім, розділений ізсередини, не може встояти, а український дім стоїть у сантиметрах від прірви. Єдність - це останнє, що може цей дім врятувати, якщо ще не пізно..."
 POLITICS_YAROSLAV_STETSKO_DESC: "Мораль не має місця в ідеальному світі Ярослава Стецька. Її стерли разом із багатьма іншими ідіотськими поняттями, коли він у юному  віці дізнався про Бандерову мудрість. Саме тоді він зрозумів своє призначення - присвятити своє життя вільній і чистій Україні. Таким тарганам, як Сціборський, не вистачало волі - він же був вільний, готовий позбавити свою націю від тих, що її бруднили - євреїв, комуністів і всіх інших менших рас.\n\nНімеччина, можливо, і вирішила ці проблеми, але Україна залишилася борсатися в бруді, потерпаючи від неналежної опіки з боку цього невігласа-расиста Коха. Грубий, поглинутий власними упередженнями, він не знав про праці Липи, які доводили, що українці мають ту саму генетичну приналежність, що й німці. Проте Кох тримав їх у рабстві, відкидаючи науку, аж поки УПА не була змушена довести силу своєї раси.\n\nНарод обрав його, щоб він став українським Гітлером, позбавив свою націю від болячок і перетворив націоналізм на націонал-соціалізм. Стецькові землі стануть раєм, подивившись на який сам Бандера усміхнеться. Лише тоді Німеччина побачить помилковість своїх шляхів і прийме Україну як брата, незабаром об'єднавшись у боротьбі проти юдо-більшовизму."
 POLITICS_STEPAN_LENKAVSKYI_DESC: "Найперша заповідь із найвідомішого твору Степана Ленкавського звучить так: «Здобудеш Українську Державу, або загинеш у боротьбі за Неї.». Тепер, оточений зрадою з усіх боків, Ленкавський впевнений, що виконає цю обіцянку.\n\nЦя праця, «Декалог українського націоналіста», була лише однією з багатьох статей і заяв, які Ленкавський написав у перші роки існування ОУН. Він був запеклим і радикальним націоналістом, вірним донцовським ідеалам у душі, який вірив ні в що інше, як у повну українську зверхність.\n\nПотім прийшла Друга світова війна, і з'явився шанс довести свою силу. Він не втримався. Спочатку він працював з німцями, стояв поруч із їхніми ескадронами смерті під час погромів. Потім, коли вони зрадили справу, він дав їм відсіч, як звірам, якими вони й були. Відтоді потік крові був нескінченним, і він ніколи не припиняв проливати її далі.\n\nБагато в чому кар'єра Ленкавського навряд чи була унікальною для його організації. Проте щоразу, коли йому надавалася можливість пом'якшити свої погляди або змінити методи, він робив це з подвійною енергією. Його бачення України загострилося, очистилося. Якщо хтось хоче його змінити, він може посперечатися з його кулями."

Для деяких інших, він зрадник, що зрадив двічі - спочатку себе, тоді німців. А для когось він кровожерливий звір, що виправдовує вбивства поляків тим, що це лиш засіб для досягнення мети.\n\nШухевичу не дали перейняти на себе лідерство в ОУН після смерті Бандери через ідеологічну чистоту організаціїї, однак він домовився зі своїми суперниками про збереження єдності.\n\nНезважаючи на те, Шухевич - людина, що ставиться вороже до фанатизму Клячківського, і тому він вважає, що йому потрібно діяти. Однак сумніви затьмарюють кожну його думку. Ударивши Клячківського в спину і покинувши ідеї перманентної революції зробить його нічим не кращим за Мельника.\n\nОднак роки німецької окупації і експлуатації накладають свій відбиток на націю, і навіть УПА змушена буде йти на компроміс зі своїми старими підходами. Справжні патріоти розуміють, що виживання України набагато важливіше, ніж жалюгідні політичні чвари, а от чи зможе до цього дійти решта членів УПА - покаже час.§!"
 BOV_Stepan_Lenkavskyi_hog_desc: "§YПерший міністр при Вожді\nУльтранаціоналізм§!\n--------------\n§LСтепан Ленкавський, автор Заповідей Українського Націоналіста, був Бандеровим союзником із самого початку діяльності славетного революціонера. Ленкавський, як умілий управлінець і де-факто очільник із цивільних питань, підходить до своєї роботи із найзапеклішим запалом, адже перманентна революція не може стати успішною за кордоном, якщо провалиться удома. Як права рука Клячківського, він зробить усе можливе, аби виконати своє завдання, чого б це не вартувало.§!"
 BOV_Dmytro_Myron_for_desc: "§YГолова політичного відділу ОУН\nУльтранаціоналізм§!\n--------------\n§LДмитро Мирон, як близький союзник Ленкавського і Бандери, вірно служив ОУН-Б і УПА ідеологом. Мирон завжди був палким прихильником концепції верховної влади національної держави, і відповідні ідеї пропагандував у маси, заохочуючи українців у межах її кордонів і поза ними до повстання проти гнобителів, аби Україна змогла бути єдиною від Сяну по Кавказ. Зарево кривавої війни видніється на горизонті, і Мирон знову розпалює в серцях українців бажання боротися з поневолювачами.§!"
 BOV_Vasyl_Halasa_eco_desc: "§YСекретар фінансово-господарських справ\nУльтранаціоналізм§!\n--------------\n§LВасиль Галаса - людина, знайома з бідністю і складнощами в житті, адже й сам працював каменярем після смерті батька, аби допомогти родині. Він намагався здобути економічну освіту, але закінчив її лише наполовину, перш ніж приєднався до ОУН і УПА та брав участь у тих трагічних подіях, пов'язаних із організаціями. Клячківський готує народу до завоювань, і Галаса має підживити ці зусилля усіма можливими способами. Навіть із його незакінченою освітою, місця для сумніву не може бути. Або процвітання, або загибель.§!"
 BOV_Mykhailo_Medvid_sec_desc: "§YКрайовий провідник\nУльтранаціоналізм§!\n--------------\n§LМихайло Медвідь - справжній екземпляр перманентної революції. Медвідь, як близький підлеглий Клячківського, успішно проводив операції з тренування солдатів, розробляв комунікаційні мережі, розбудовував публічну підтримку. Офіцери лягали кістками у боротьбі, а Медвідь зайняв їхне місце, показавши свій талант як командира і непохитну вірність справі звільнення. Усі українці повинні прагнути брати приклад із Медвідя, бо Медвідь прагне до їхньої свободи.§!"
 BOV_Yaroslav_Stetsko_for_desc: "§YГолова із політичного виховання\nНаціонал-соціалізм§!\n--------------\n§LЯрослава Стецька визначають чотири речі: його невмируща вірність Бандері, його глибока ненависть до комунізму, його обширний інтелект і повна відсутність моралі як такої. Стецько спершу подружився з Бандерою після сварки зі Сціборським, яку тому ніколи не пробачить. Як і Бандеру, Стецька глибоко надихають націоналістські думки, і люди ще не можуть повністю визначати, до якої міри.\n\nЯк цивільна особа на владній посаді, Ярослав Стецько перебуває у досить рідкісному становищі. Як людину із високим інтелектом і хитрістю, йому було вручено унікальне завдання - координувати операції в тому логістичному пеклі, яким є роздерті війною поля битв України. Зрештою, накази самі не досягають тих, хто повинен їх виконувати.\n\nАле Стецькові особисті упередження просочуються у ці розпорядження, немовби краплі отрути, що просочуються у колодязь. Час від часу в кожну криївку УПА приходить повідомлення, що містить попередження про єврейське проникнення до підрозділів або захист Німеччини. Багато хто ігнорує їх, але з кожним днем усе більше й більше людей виявляються переконаними Стецьковими закидами до союзництва із Німеччиною заради спільної боротьби проти большевизму.§!"

Поразки перманентної революції у об'єднанні України лишили Кука із сумом на душі, і з віком та досвідом до нього прийшло й повне усвідомлення страждань свого народу.

Його вплив, як одного із найбільш ранніх пропонентів до змін, ріс, особливо серед деморалізованих загонів УПА. Хоч ідеї про об'єднаний фронт можуть виглядати надто вже радикально чи навіть по-зрадницьки, це не хвилює Позичанюка. Перемога проти німців означає діяти радикально, навіть якщо це значить утілити немислиме.§!"

Як правник, він представляв членів ОУН у суді під час польської окупації українських земель. Зараз же Горбовий слугує одним із небагатьох цивільних управлінців зі значним досвідом в УПА. Жорстокість і ізоляція від українського народу, що лиш зростають, хвилює старого юриста, і він боїться, що УПА буде зруйнована, якщо та не зможе виправити її курс.§!"

Його єдине бажання - мирна Україна, вільна від іноземного втручання, від страждання, країна, в якій його донька зможе жити в мирі. Волошин відсторонив себе від жорстокості Клячківського, і тепер він довіряє своїм товаришам: можливо, вони зможуть зробити все краще.§!"

Буття умілим організатором і управлінцем наблизило набожного Ребета до молодого революціонера. Ребет приєднався до Стецькового плану зі співпрацею з Німеччиною, бачачи це єдиним шляхом, при якому УПА зможе справді отримати довготривалу незалежність. Він вірно служить із гіркою посмішкою і аурою вини. Можна лише дивуватися, чи справді Ребет щирий до себе чи до інших.§!"
 BOV_Dmytro_Maivsky_for_desc: "§YСекретар закордонних справ\nВійськова хунта§!\n--------------\n§LДмитро Маївський - генерал УПА, що мав близькі зв'язки зі Стецьком зі старих часів ОУН. Його здатність переконувати інших була безцінною для залучення більшості вищого командування УПА до союзу зі Стецьком заради захисту від чисток Клячківського та Лебедя.

Першопочатково він був відповідальним за управління лісовим господарством, однак його досвід був критично важливим для захисту упівців від повітряних розвідників, і він досить швидко задружився зі Стецьком. Підвищення П'ясецького від управління лісами до управління економікою загалом викликає питання. Лісник хоче переконати, що його опоненти неправі, але він нездатний зрозуміти, що його невідповідність посаді якраз і є причиною, чому він є ідеальним кандидатом.§!"

Лебедь завоював довіру Клячківського брутальними методами, які дозволили його справжнім нахилам у бік Стецька лишитися непоміченими. Амбіції Стецька скоро будуть втілені.

Це не заміна справжній боротьбі на полях битв, але роль обмежених усе ще лишається актуальною для тих, хто зараз на передовій."

 BOV_every_man_a_soldier_desc: "Що таке український чоловік, якщо він не може воювати за свою націю? Що це за нація, якщо вона не може використати кожен свій елемент заради перемоги? УПА вирішила, що жоден чоловік, незалежно від його положення в суспільстві чи чеснот, не може бути вищою за смерть за свою націю. Армія тепер матиме всіх у своїх рядах - слабких і сильних, підлітків і старих. Можливо, вони не такі здібні, але вони, безумовно, можуть служити."

 BOV_retributive_cleansing_desc: "Як би важко не було це визнавати, але наша країна та її сини мають удосталь сороміцьких, огидних зрадників і підлих істот. Зрештою, щодо несправедливостей, вчинених нашій нації у часи, коли ми були найслабшими, не можна навіть розглядати питання примирення - ми не можемо пробачити, і ніколи ми не забудемо. За цієї причини, поки останній зрадник України не буде знищений і поки останні опозиційні до програми УПА сили не будуть придушені, нам слід продовжувати правління терору проти цих покидьків, що підривали і зраджували країну, доки вони не будуть винищені на наших землях і ніколи більше не зможуть становити для нас загрозу."

Завдяки українській завзятості та унікальній силі методу управління УПА, ми відновимо політику українізації радянського уряду, єдина позитивна сторона дисфункціональної, дегенеративної маріонетки Бухаріна. Після возз'єднання України всі ці гріхи минулого будуть вирішені, а українська держава стоятиме вічно. Перший крок до цього великого досягнення буде зроблено, коли УПА визволить Україну, а разом із цим з'явиться унікальний виклик - УНРА.\n\nХоча УНРА є очевидною маріонеткою польських інтересів, вона все ще викликає певну симпатію у багатьох в межах наших кордонів. Недооцінювати цю зграйку деградуючих демократичних партизанів - велика помилка, однак наразі нашим єдиним рішенням проти цього ворога є швидкий удар, який змусить замовкнути ці голоси симпатії."

 BOV_vozhd_commands_desc: "Історія України - історія болю, принижень, зрад і руйнувань. Забагато людей хотіли взяти до своїх рук стерно влади, щоб змінити цю ситуацію, і всі претенденти виявилися неспроможними. Однак усе змінилося, і шлях до перемоги проявив себе. Допоки народ не завагається. Допоки народ довіряє.\n\nВождь чітко проявив своє бачення свободи, і його накази повернуть нації вогонь, а населенню - силу. Цю свободу буде здобуто лише якщо народ доєднається до них у братерстві й зосередженості. Україна знову буде цілою.\n\nДовіртеся Вождю!"
 BOV_dissent_dark_desc: "Українцю притаманна нетерпимість до пригноблення, українець прагне свободи від іноземного контролю на будь-який лад. Українець сильний і впертий, тож Вождь, із усіма його чеснотами, розусіє і поділяє цю доблесну рису. А ще він розуміє, як її підкреслити.\n\nБагато потенційних героїв України вже розірвали кайдани, в які їх закували, і тепер борються за визволення своїми способами. Вождь мусить, може згуртувати їх і він це зробить - покаже їм найдостойнішу справу, якій вони можуть присвятити себе, і, в свою чергу, посіяти насіння загального й масованого повстання."
 BOV_rage_ranks_desc: "Кажуть, що солдати Вождя - не більше, ніж селяни з гвинтівками, нетреновані й нездатні вести сучасний бій. Ті, хто так кажуть, закривають очі на їхню найважливішу характеристику - лють. Сліпу, переважаючу всі почуття лють, що підтримують такі почуття, як вірність, рішучість і патріотизм, не зрівняти з жодними іншими почуттями у світі.\n\nНа цих якостях потрібно звернути увагу, ставити їх у приклад і демонструвати тим, хто ставить під сумнів абсолютну відданість Вождя і його солдатів справі забезпечення волі для України та її народу. Ми не мовчатимемо. Ми не будемо споглядати без діла. Ми не будемо тими, кого можна контролювати."
 BOV_bloody_fray_desc: "Нарешті настав час. Після років відбудови, втеч, приховування себе, ми більше не робитимемо цього. Вождь, із усіма його чеснотами, які він завжди має і матиме, завершив його плани підготовки до Третьої битви - наші вороги не знають, наскільки близькі ми до руйнування їх.\n\nУсе, що тепер повинен зробити Вождь - показати план своїм вірним підлеглим, щоби ті донесли його до ліній фронту і запалили ту іскру, що так довго спала в серцях людей."
 BOV_connections_faithless_desc: "Яким би огидним він не був, Стецько правий як мінімум у одному - у нього є зв'язки. Зрадницькі елементи - які отримають своє справедливе покарання в належний час - значно послабили наші зв'язки як із нашими братами, так і з простими людьми поза окупованими Райхскомісаріятом землями.\n\nМи повинні відновити ці зв'язки, якщо хочемо досягнути успіху в майбутніх битвах, адже їхня підтримка та сприяння будуть критично важливими. Таким чином, ми повинні дослухатися до Стецька, і попрацювати над тим, аби слідувати його порадам. Аби досягти бажаного славного майбутнього, потрібно йти на жертви."
 BOV_carnage_righteous_desc: "У міру того, як у нашому плані з'являються фінальні штрихи, звинувачення від Стецька й Шухевича, що в ньому лишаються численні діри, лише зростають. Вони можуть і надалі намагатися «полагодити» його так, як їм заманеться, але Вождя більше не зможуть відкидати - і він почне Третю битву.\n\nЗусилля Вождя самі по собі закладають підґрунтя абсолютній перемозі, і, щойно ми її досягнемо, це назавжди унеможливить існування «сумнівів» у його планах. Жоден більше не зважиться кинути йому виклик."
 BOV_charisma_treacherous_desc: "Шухевич був проблемним із самого початку, адже говорив завжди те, що думав - і завжди якнайбільш відкрито - про неналежність реаліям наших солдатів, озброєння і підготовчих заходів. Завжди обережно натякає, що Вождь робив помилки. Його б давно замінили, однак, на жаль, його популярність серед офіцерського складу і значний військовий талант забезпечують йому захист.\n\nВін зберігатиме свою посаду голови, як мінімум поки що. Він працюватиме над розв'язанням проблем, і матиме змогу говорите, що схоче. Однак усе буде записано. Усе запам'ятають."
 BOV_patriots_poland_desc: "Незважаючи на те, скільки б ми не мали гвинтівок і як би населення підтримувало чи не підтримувало нас, завжди існує одна річ, якої ми потребуємо - борців. Їх важко знайти, а змотивувати ще важче. Але деяких, розсіяних по всій Ґенеральній губерній, ми все ж знайшли.\n\nТам усі: полішуки, поляки, Кубійович і йому подібні - борються із німцями. Вони б'ють по блокпостах, залізничних лініях, колаборантах та іншим об'єктам. Якщо ми зуміємо відновити з ними контакт, якщо ми зможемо відбудувати зносини з ними, вони зможуть усе ще служити й допомагати справі. Навіть якщо це лише спосіб відволікти ненависних окупантів."
 BOV_unleash_sluzhba_bezpeky_desc: "Хоч цей факт і неймовірно засмучує, але наш рух не позбавлений своїх злочинців, зрадників і ненадійний елементів, і, щоби розбиратися із ними ефективно, необхідно відповідно забезпечити і підтримати Службу безпеки. Наразі вона не є достатньо забезпеченою й не відчуває підтримки, і це створює загрозу не лише для Бандерових бажань, а й його величним візіям нашого майбутнього.\n\nЇхня роль є критичною, а продовження падіння їхньої здатності виконувати завдання недопустиме. У Службу безпеки потрібно вдихнути життя, їм потрібні свіжі ресурси. Ми надамо усе необхідне."
 BOV_galicia_forays_desc: "Століттями тому Європа страждала від чорної смерті через нестачу знань із того, який вплив мають щурі й інші гризуни на цивілізоване суспільство. Хвороба, гниль і розкладання, падіння порядку, і, зрештою, смерть - це те, що чекає на кожну державу, що ігнорує загрозу, яку можуть нести гризуни, хай вони будуть буквальними чи метафоричними.\n\nУкраїнська національна революційна армія є такими гризунами, брудом, що чіпляється до кожного гарного вкраїнця, викривлюючи світ у його голові, і навіть таргани мають ґлузд і не пишаються своїм огидним існуванням - а УНРА не вдається приписати собі навіть цю чесноту. Настав час викурити цих настирливих лизоблюдів із Галичини, так само, як викурюють щурятники."
 BOV_instill_commandments_desc: "Ніщо не прищеплює більше гордості за те, що ти є українцем, ніж марш гордих солдатів зі сталевими обличчями, що тримають гвинтівки високо - нічого, окрім гордості й любові до нашого прапору, повне презирство до тих, хто насмілиться паплюжити його, до тих людей, податливих, непостійних, людей, що занадто загрузли в страху, лінощах і жадібності.\n\nГляньте на наш прапор! Дивіться на красу нашої землі, наших чистих людей! Наш Вождь, наша історія, наш родовід! Ця гордість, ця радість у нашому народі - щось, що ми не можемо вловити до кінця, але навіть описати величину любові, що ми повинні відчувати до України, досить важко для простої людини.\n\nОднак наші солдати не будуть простими людьми. Вони матимуть колективний розум, царина, яку ця любов заповнить повністю, відштовхуючи все, що не потрібно знати, аж поки солдати не будуть такими ж ревними й відповідальними, як наш великодушний очільник."
 BOV_insurgency_years_desc: "Із початком нацистської окупації УПА набрала в свої ряди багато сміливих душ, що боролися за Україну, деякі з них борються з часів революції 1917-го року. Найвеличніша українська армія отримала великий привілей бути свідками того, як такі патріоти борються за нашу справу, і ми не повинні втрачати цей привілей. Не всі з наших найостанніших новобранців навчені хоча б чверті того, що вміють ті солдати, і саме час змінити це.\n\nНайкращі з найкращих повинні тренувати найсвіжіших наших рекрутів, аби загальна маса нашої армії не залишалася ненавченим натовпом. Тоді й лиш тоді, коли ми навчимо цих людей навичкам, що мають лише наші ветерани, ми зможемо дійсно підготуватися до революції так, як нам треба. Німецьким тактикам буде навчено, важливості збереження холоднокровності буде навчено, а прості поради з влучності, без жодного сумніви, широко розповсюдяться. Незабаром наша армія знатиме, як стріляти й убивати краще, ніж будь-який гарнізон Вермахту може уявити навіть у найгірших своїх кошмарах."
 BOV_marshal_craftsmen_desc: "Хоч у нас і існує серйозна нестача людського ресурсу, хоч ми й можемо технічно озброїти тих солдатів, що вже маємо, заявити, що ми їх «озброємо» - дуже, дуже перебільшено сказано, враховуючи озброєння, що ми маємо у нашому розпорядженні. Багато наших солдатів досі воюють озброєнням своїх дідів, а деякі наші склади «мосінок» є старшими за солдатів, що ними користуються.\n\nНа щастя, звісно, такі ситуації не є більшістю в армії, як мінімум, поки що не є. У нас є певні зброярі, що забезпечують нас відносно сучасною українською зброєю. Однак цього все ще недостатньо, як мінімум, поки що недостатньо. Підвищивши вміння деяких наших зброярів-початківців, ми зможемо значно підняти кількісні показники виробництва нашого озброєння - і скоро наші солдати воюватимуть не ножами й мисливськими рушницями, а справжньою українською автоматичною зброєю."
 BOV_carpathian_connection_desc: "Багато років тому наші браття в Карпатах мріяли про державу, про місце, яке карпатські українці зможуть назвати своїм. На короткий період часу цю мрію було майже втілено, аж тут угорці вбили її у зародку. Більшість змирилися і пішли далі. Але не всі.\n\nДехто з них ніколи не зупиняв опору, і, хоч їхні ряди малі (і з часом лиш скорочувалися), ті, що лишаються, мають навички і знання, які важко з чимось порівнювати. Нам треба завоювати їхню прихильність і використати ці їхні якості."
 BOV_steadfast_watchers_desc: "Ми боролися, стікали кров'ю й помирали роками, борячись за народ України і за перманентну революцію. Більшість наших людей визнають це. Більшість - не всі. Забагато людей, здається, призабули жертви, які ми робили заради боротьби з Німеччиною, і заграють найнебезпечнішим чином із республіканським лихом. Необхідно їм нагадати.\n\nДеяких із наших найбільш визначних невірних буде вистежено і публічно покарано. Народ знатиме, що ми і непохитні, і наглядливі, а тому завжди готові видаляти ракову пухлину, якою є невірність."
 BOV_blood_soil_desc: "Най не буде жодного, хто заявить, що ми не давали дипломатії й шансу.\n\nБагато разів ми нагадували незаконним окупантам, кому насправді належить земля, яку вони запрацьовували до смерті, злочин їхнього перебування на нашій законній території, і що доти, доки вони покинуть нас, забравши свої деструктивні елементи і людей, ми будемо готові лишити минуле в минулому; якщо вони припинять нас зневажати, їхній час прийде, але його принесе не наша рука.\n\nОднак вони все ще лишаються тут, розмножуючись, ніби кролі, псуючи й перекроюючи нашу історію одним своїм подихом, знущаючись над нами своєю впертістю, ігноруванням наших попереджень! Якщо вони так люблять нашу територію, то най їхня кров і тіла стануть добривом для наступного покоління українців, що претендуватимуть на землю, якої вони цілком заслуговують."
 BOV_wraiths_night_desc: "Перша битва, що була роки тому, навчила нам багато важливих, але дорогих уроків. Першопочаткові масові повстання були моментально майже придушені, а ті наші солдати, що пережили репресії або ті, яким просто пощастили, навчилися виживати - у них не було іншого вибору. Авіація бомбардувала нас, танки переїжджали наші барикади, патрулі, що тримали нас загнаними в підпілля, - усі вони призводили до смертей наших воїнів. І де ми зараз?\n\nМи пристосувалися. Ми навчилися саботувати літаки ще до того, як ті піднімуться з летовища. Ми навчилися кидати коктейлі Жданова по слабких місцях панцерів, ми навчилися створювати СВП. Ми навчилися ховатися й влаштовувати засідки на нескінченні патрулі, і грабувати їх іще до того, як хтось здогадається, що їх було стерто з лиця землі. І німці не пробачили собі цього й досі. Іще досі не всі з перелічених тактик було закріплено, тож ми повинні розповсюдити їх серед усіх солдатів на місцях. Нацисти лише зневажають за все те, що ми зробили, і ми ще далеко не закінчили з ними."
 BOV_farmer_chemist_desc: "Панцери, що тримають німецького чобота на нашому горлі, не є невразливими, на відміну від Люфтваффе, і у випадку панцерників ми знайшли шляхи знищення цього броньованого бича України.\n\nСаморобні вибухові пристрої, скорочено СВП, є ідеальним рішенням проблеми німецьких танків, що стирають наші наземні сили. Німецькі танки бояться нас через те, що ми здатні завдати їхнім танкам із 50-х років, і це прийшло із практикою і вдосконаленням наших СВП. Здається, тим матеріалом, що ми найбільше потребуємо для цих нових дизайнів, що кумедно, є добриво. Де ще ми можемо знайти добрива, як не в перетворених у рабів працівників на фермах? Співпраця з тими, хто нещодавно втік або кого звільнили з плантацій, може значно допомогти нам у виробництві СВП. Іще трохи - і Україну буде звільнено від німецької бронетехніки, по одному панцернику за раз."
 BOV_odessa_operatives_desc: "Це зрозуміло, але надзвичайно сумно, що багато наших так званих братів і сестер прийняли румунське панування над Одесою і територіях навколо, лише заради того, аби жити вільно від нацистської тиранії. Утім, хоч їх і мало, серед них є люди, які готові боротися за вільну Україну.\n\nКонтакти налагоджено, і вони готові допомогти з контрабандою зброї завдяки зв'язкам Одеси зі світом. Але від нас вимагають ціну. Ту, що ми готові заплатити."
 BOV_gun_down_guard_desc: "Розмах і чисельність Української національної революційної армії набагато, набагато більші, ніж ті, що значилися в звітах чи ті, які ми очікували. Агентів УНРА знаходять усюди, вони розпорошилися по нижчих щаблях державних органів. Купу сховищ і сховків було знайдено, і стає очевидним, що УНРА намагаються повернути український народ проти нас.\n\nЦього не можна допустити, і Стецько чітко заявив, що в разі, якщо ми дозволимо гнилі розростатися без жодної опозиції до неї, вона поглине нас досить швидко. Ми вживатимемо заходів. Ми вдаримо по УНРА й відновимо наші позиції та безпеку."
 BOV_traitors_due_desc: "Хоч ніхто й не сперечатиметься, що республіканці, якими б вони не були занепадницькими й непомірно гордовитими, не є загрозою державі, Стецько забагато зосереджується на них, чомусь вважаючи їхні слабкості силою. Роблячи це, втім, він пропускає справжню загрозу - євреїв-мельниківців, які роками набивали кишені завдяки співпраці з німцями.\n\nЦих зрадників неможливо виправдати, і ми не робитимемо тієї ж помилки, що й Стецько. Ми визначимо тих, хто стане прикладом для інших, а ті швидко зрозуміють, що їхні дні полічені."
 BOV_nationalist_commissariat_desc: "Оскільки національна боротьба триває, ми повинні лишатися зосередженими на нашій остаточній цілі - перемозі - і на тому, чого ми потребуємо для її здобуття. Однією з таких потреб є відданість. Моральний дух. Самовіддача. У цьому ми повинні втямити, що Шухевич, хоч він і був правий про критичну важливість селянства, що формує стрижень боротьби, не усвідомлює їхні інші, менш бажані якості.\n\nМи повинні заволодіти людьми, яких не так просто заплутати чи ввести в оману, і  заради цього ми повинні прийняти той факт, що набір новобранців повинен концентруватися на людях, що можуть утілити в життя Бандерові вчення. Серед таких людей ми заотримаємо відданих солдатів без жодних проблем із моральним духом."
 BOV_return_roots_desc: "Серед усієї Європи, хто може розуміти гноблення краще, ніж українці? Ніж український фермер, якщо бути вже зовсім точним. Усю нашу історію - від закріпачення мерзенними росіянами і до авторитарної централізації, що проводили совєти, - мало над ким знущалися більше, ніж над простим скромним фермером. На них базується українська культура, вони є самим фундаментом держави, і вони, схоже, знають про це.\n\nПо всьому заходу України почалися втечі рабів-фермерів із їхніх сіл-тюрем. Вони збиваються в зграї, формуючи таке собі ополчення, що в світлі зростання анархії по всій Україні здається мудрим рішенням. Застосувавши певну міру вмінь переконувати, здається можливим, що всіх цих ополченців-селян можна буде запросити до нашого великого альянсу, і що ми зможемо воювати за нашу волю. Разом. Фермери й солдати - пліч-о-пліч. Лиш тоді ми зможемо забезпечити волю Україні."
 BOV_thunder_mountains_desc: "Карпати - неймовірне місце для щезання людей, хай там якою буде ціль подорожі в гори: пошук себе, вчинення злочинів, або ж, що так само можливо, боротьба проти іноземних поневолювачів. Ми, звісно ж, потужно й ефективно користувалися цими горами за часів Першої битви, тієї, що була проти поляків, москалів і німців. Ми нападали там, де вони найменше того очікували, а після того швидко зникали серед гір - на той момент, коли вони помічали, що щось не так, ми вже були приховані, разом із важким озброєнням і іншою здобиччю. Звісно ж, це означає, що останні звіти про те, що наші люди змогли знайти старі артилерійські установки часів Першої битви, не стали для нас несподіванкою. Тож направмо людей дістати цю зброю з її різноманітних хованок - вона подарує нам гарну вогневу міць."

Тепер, із новинами про смерть цього курв'ячого сина в Ґерманії, стає очевидним, що кращої можливості для нас звільнити величну Україну не буде.\n\nЗродились ми великої години, години хороброго супротиву й боротьби за волю України. Хоч нас і знову й знову перестрівали часи поразки в боротьбі проти москалів, німців і ляхів, ми знекровлювали їх сили й лишалися здатними до боротьби щоразу, коли ті вважали, що перемогли. Ми - воїни, народжені, щоби звільнити нашу кохану Україну. Під керівництвом Вождя ми точно зуміємо отримати перемогу, зможемо очистити й звільнити Українську державу!\n\nО, Бандеро, батьку наш і визволителю, глянь на нашу боротьбу із гордістю!

Неважливо, яка ціна, який ворог, нам треба боротися з ним заради України. Заради Бандери.

Це стосується й національних селян. Забагато із них були(або навіть і є) колаборантами. Або й гірше.\n\nУтім, у нас нема вибору. Нам потрібні люди, ми маємо заповнити ряди, інакше ми будемо переможеними. Їх треба рекрутувати і дати умовну підготовку. Можливо, деякі дізнаються про свій героїзм.

Ми не можемо дозволити собі такої розкоші. Тож так і вирішується питання озброєння селян.\n\nДійсно, це дасть нам такий потрібний приплив ополченців, однак ми не можемо жодним чином переконатися в їхній вірності в національному масштабі, тому вони залишаться в своїх місцевих оборонних регіонах.

Тут досі працюють старі комплекси тракторного заводу, і вони дають нам надзвичайну можливість, якщо перевести їх виробництво на військові потреби.\n\nПереобладнана техніка, що раніше була тракторами, а тоді стала бойовим транспортом, дасть нам значну перевагу в прийдешніх боях, особливо проти інших нерегулярних військових формувань. Така дія матиме певну ціну, але її переваги не можна ігнорувати."
 BOV_galicia_veins_desc: "За часів загарбників Галичина перетворилася на диво децентралізованої промисловості. Малі майстерні, кустарні фабрики, цехи для виробництва - усі ці декадентські будівлі викликали б огиду в кожного справжнього українця. Утім, ми не можемо дозволити собі ігнорувати цей ресурс у такі важкі часи.\n\nЩо можна перевести на військове виробництво, буде переведено після експропріації. Усе, що не вдасться - продати, а той дріб'язок виторгу реінвестувати у боротьбу. Галицька індустрія працюватиме на спільну працю тим чи іншим способом."

Довгий досвід ховання у тих же лісах зробили наших людей чимось штибу експертів у використанні і експлуатації їх.\n\nЦі навички можна використати, швидко й винахідливо укріпивши лісисті райони проти Поліської січі. Кожна оборонна лінія, яку ми створимо, посилить наші позиції та вивільнять трохи тиску на наш цінний людський ресурс. Ми повинні всіляко заохочувати подібні роботи."

Невинна людина тримає несправедливості, які скоїли проти нашого народу, близько до свого серця, ніколи не дозволяючи своєму розуму гуляти в бік бажань компромісу чи примирення. Він непохитний, коли переслідує ворогів народу, спиняючи свою руку лише тоді, коли останній ворог України лежить мертвим біля його ніг. Винна людина, тим часом, навряд чи потребує представлення. Така людина є опортуністом, змією, що продасть своїх співвітчизників через боягузство, байдужість, а можливо, що й через злі наміри.\n\nНа жаль, у рядах УПА деякі люди почали дивитися на винних у іншому світлі: вони почали симпатизувати погляду, що деяку частину тих, хто співпрацював із Німеччиною, ще не пізно врятувати. Це фантастичне, майже дитяче уявлення, і це в кращому випадку, тож ми повинні викорінити його до того, коли воно матиме змогу розцвісти.

Ми повинні бути готовими.\n\nУ такому разі нашими останніми твердинями будуть міста, і нам слід зробити з них сталеві казани, видобуваючи бочки крові за кожен крок, який вороги зроблять усередину. Кожен транспортний засіб, кожна будівля буде перетворено на опорну точку, і наші вороги будуть знекровлені добіла, намагаючись узяти місто, вулицю за вулицею."

Ці черви - виродки людства, і кожен із них звинувачується в тому, що ставив свої інтереси, а також інтереси іноземних загарбників, вище за інтереси України. Це страшний злочин, що можна змити лише кров'ю.\n\nОдні з них благають про помилування, пропонуючи свої послуги нашій справі, співаючи порожні пісні про їхню вірність нації. Зрештою, цілком навіть природньо для таких, як вони, покірно підкорюватися своїм поневаолювачам! Які б навички ця мерзота не мала, вони лиш крапля в морі порівняно з глибиною їхніх гріхів. У кожному місті, що наразі знаходиться під контролем УПА, буде проведено публічну страту, аби продемонструвати всім високу ціну за зраду своїх співвітчизників."
 BOV_second_struggle_avenged_desc: "Після важкої кампанії на західних землях України, так звана УНРА пала переможеною під нашим натиском. Їхній крихкий республіканський рух був розтрощений на порох, і це ознаменувало новий розділ у гонитві за вільною та незалежною Україною, розділ, який формуватиме патріотична бандерівська думка, а не слабким республіканізмом, який так ревно сповідували Поліська Січ і їхні ляльководи. Усе, що лишається, - прийти на допомогу нашим братам на Сході, що все що страждають під владою тиранів. Останні кроки до об'єднання вже на відстані руки, а доля України висить на волосині. Битва не скінчиться, доки ми не одержимо перемогу, незважаючи на те, як багато людей віддадуть свої життя во ім'я визволення!"
 BOV_nourishing_bodies_desc: "Колись Украна була однією з найбільш плодючих земель у всій Євразії, її нескінченні поля зерна слугували хлібницею багатьом державам світу. Ці дні, на жаль, давно минули. Люди України, із чиїх земляних ресурсів совєцька і нацистська машини дістали все досуха, чиї землі випалені війною, що зараз спустошує нашу батьківщину, мають дуже небагато, аби наситити свої животи. Хоч наші війська й самі мають проблеми з провізією на кожен день, дозволити народу голодувати - серйозне порушення наших обов'язків перед Україною. Наші й без того мізерні пайки буде урізано ще більше, аби надати певне полегшення життя, хоч і короткострокове, людям. Най цей жест доброти слугує ще одним нагадуванням про доброзичливість УПА та про нащу відданість добробуту України!"
 BOV_enriching_minds_desc: "У більшості своїй головні цілі УПА досить прості для розуміння. Нас цікавить лише повне звільнення України від іноземних пригноблювачів і зрадників ізсередини, а також помста за десятиліття несправедливостей, які вчиняли з її народом. Утім, існують ті, хто сумніваються в нашій чесності, ті, чиї голови затуманили здоровенні павутини брехні, що плетуть наші вороги.\n\nУбивці! Ґвалтівники! Варвари! Усі ці гіперболізовані слова, і не лише вони, все частіше й частіше використовуються, аби оббрехати нашу справедливу справу, і якщо заходів не буде вжито, народ може стати зачарованим цими брехливими звинуваченнями. Необхідно розпочати освітню програму, аби популяризовувати чесноти УПА і пояснювати нашим співвітчизникам, що ми прийшли визволителями, а не завойовниками. Перемога може бути здобута лише якщо серця нації б'ються як одне, і коли всі - від генерала найвищого рангу і до найпростішого селянина - здатні стояти за спільну справу."
 BOV_swell_ironworks_desc: "Ми повертаємо все більше України, а разом із цим ми повертаємо собі ресурси і промисловий потенціал, а ще ми відновили деякі лінії постачання та збуту, які були перебиті після початку конфлікту. Це, однак, не означає, що вони одразу оперуватимуть знову, і доведеться попрацювати, щоби відновити роботу заводів, що простоюють.\n\nЦе робота, яку варто, ні, потрібно виконати. Боротьба ще не скінчена, і в нас має бути більше військових матеріалів для підтримки тих фронтів, що ще досі активні. Усім буде вигідно побачити ці величні ливарні знову в робочому стані."
 BOV_industrial_battalions_desc: "Роки окупації і колабораторської «освіти», на жаль, призвели до того, що лише зовсім невеличка частка наших співвітчизників має щось, що можна було б вважати технічними навичками. Відповідно, ми маємо знайти шляхи виправити це, якщо плануємо розширити нашу експертну робочу силу, і ми отримали пропозицію.\n\nТі кілька інженерів, що ми маємо, отримають посади офіцерів і стануть при командуванні робітничих батальйонів, і завданням їхнім буде передати навички. Так, це буде до болючого повільний процес, однак із часом він відіграє свою роль у зростанні нашої робочої сили у технічних галузях."
 BOV_rebuild_plast_desc: "У дні давньої минувщини Пласт був горнилом, у якому виплавили багатьох нинішніх генералів УПА. Колись це була скаутська організація для молодих студентів, ціллю якої було навчити їх шляхам виживання в дикій природі і найважливішим навичкам очільника. Ця організація надала УПА незліченну кількість талановитих офіцерів, і якщо ми хочемо закласти насіння наступного покоління, нам потрібен новий Пласт.\n\nВідродивши пластунські загони, молодь України відродить патріотичні ідеали всередині себе, навчаючись із молодого віку ставити батьківщину вище за все. У нововідновленому Пласті народиться ідея нового українського воїна: ревно відданого захисту своєї держави, гартований глибокою турботою про добробут своїх співвітчизників. У поєднанні з навичками, потрібними для того, аби вести своїх побратимів до перемоги навіть у найважчих обставинах, вони однозначно стануть справді чудовими солдатами!"
 BOV_banderite_virtue_desc: "Багато хто наполягав, аби ми послали кожного чоловіка, незважаючи на його вік, на фронт, з метою, щоби ті докладали зусиль заради перемоги. Однак ми усвідомлюємо всю безглуздість цього, адже перемоги не буде, якщо наше наступне покоління буде зруйноване в спробах досягти її, а надсилання на фронт підлітків лише гарантуватиме такий результат.\n\nВони, натомість, можуть бути набагато раціональніше використані за рахунок навчання за Бандеровими принципами. Вони можуть стати лояльними вартовими у своїй громаді, повідомляючи й захищаючи людей від занепаду етики, бути прикладом для наслідування молодшим дітям тощо."
 BOV_souls_slag_desc: "Не можна заперечити, що ми маємо надлишок хоробрих патріотів, готових воювати - і помирати - за мрію, якою є Україна. Утім, надлишку в зброї ми не маємо, а людина без зброї абсолютно не несе жодної користі на полі бою. Чого не скажеш про ливарні.\n\nБагато заводів лишаються критично недокомплектованими в результаті промислових інцидентів і небезпечних умов, і ці люди можуть служити на них. Звісно, вони готові працювати зі шлаком, якщо це допоможе забезпечити перемогу."
 BOV_every_soldier_desc: "У нашій екзистенційній боротьбі немає такого ресурсу, немає такої людини, яку не можна чіпати. Усі повинні так чи інакше служити, якщо Україна хоче бути вільною.

Такою є ситуація із розділенням нашого людського ресурсу між фронтом і заводами.\n\nЄ люди, які можуть думати, що вони мають якісь протипоказання від роботи на фабриці, і це навіть може бути правдою. Однак у них нема протипоказань до бою, і, очевидно, якщо можна не посилати їх до конвеєрної лінії, то вони можуть і будуть робити свій внесок на передовій. Боротьба потребує їх."

Певне, що ніхто з тих, що говорять правду.\n\nМи є Україна, і Україна є ми, і це твердження ніколи не було правдивішим, коли навколо кружляють вороги, що воліли б бачити наш народ і нашу культуру стертими з лиця землі.

Вони, втім, не були такими успішними, як вони відчайдушно сподівалися, і чимало з них було захоплено нашими силами. Вони повинні відповісти за злочини їхнього коханого Райху.\n\nІ вони відповідатимуть. Борг, що вони назбирали, звісно, ніколи не буде цілком виплачено, однак ми покладемо старт. Вони можуть зайняти місце рабів, яких вони так жорстоко й так довго експлуатували, і таким чином зробити свій внесок у продовження наших військових сил. Подивимося, як довго вони протримаються."

Комуністів обезголовлено, розсіяно і вибито у ліси й хащі, вони більше не в змозі здійснювати напади. Німці та їхні колаборанти були практично повністю розгромлені. Однак боротьба ще не скінчена.\n\nКрим, у його нинішньому стані - осоружний бастіон німецького впливу, усе ще стоїть, і це не може продовжуватися й надалі.

 BOV_deluge_deceit_desc: "We have been betrayed. Roman Shukhevcyh and Yaroslav Stetsko, both former Banderites, have defected to the Melnykites, exposing systemic disloyalty to the UPA, and the legacy of Stepan Bandera, who shaped this nation. Where else could there be disloyalty? The Sluzha Bezpeky? The very administration? Now, we can't trust anyone.\n\nMoving forward, we must be vigilant; it is crucial that no more defectors arise. To do this, we must thoroughly and diligently purge all disloyalty from the country. We will be vulnerable to the opposition, who will almost definitely attempt to overthrow us in our moment of weakness. This is the greatest challenge the UPA will ever face. If we prevail, our revolution will live on. Should we not, the dream of a Greater Ukraine will be extinguished."
 BOV_gut_sb_desc: "The Sluzhba Bezpeky, our secret police force, has done its part in securing the destiny of our revolution. However, in light of recent events that occurred in the UPA, we have to make some intensive changes to how it is run, and who runs it.\n\nThe SB was run by Mykola Lebed, a lapdog of Stetsko. The SB, having been run by Lebed with no oversight, has left it compromised. These two facts create an extremely concerning issue, something that can be consequential if it isn't fixed immediately."
 BOV_emergency_restructuring_desc: "There is systemic disloyalty everywhere in our government. The administration is no exception, according to our secret police. The Sluzhba Bezpeky is aware of the administrators who need to go.\n\nThe SB will round up the administrators, interrogate them, relieve them of their duties, and dispose of them. The Vozhd is prepared for this and has handpicked new administrators to replace them. Our government requires honest, loyal, and diligent administrators to function. Should our administrators not meet those requirements, they will have to be excised."
 BOV_autumn_anarchy_desc: "As predicted, the Communists and Melnykites noticed our reorganization. Like ravens on a corpse, they have once again revolted, hoping to topple our regime. Although they don't know it, they are gravely mistaken. Our revolution is not a corpse. It is alive and thriving; we shall crush them, quickly and decisively.\n\nHowever, we must act fast. These savages are ravaging the countryside, attempting to rally the people against us. To succeed, we must match their rampage with one of our own."
 BOV_peasant_pawns_desc: "The King and the Peasant. In feudal times, the King ruled and protected the peasants who worked for him. While Europe moved past this relationship, the Russians didn't. Under their incompetent rule, Russia lagged behind the rest of Europe. Now, we must modernize the relationship between the State and the Peasant.\n\nThese peasants are very conservative, and most would enthusiastically join our ranks against the Melnykites and the Bolsheviks. Should we use the peasants against them, they will help our cause. In this grand game of Chess, the peasants are nothing but our pawns."
 BOV_polish_scourge_desc: "For centuries, the Polish have oppressed the Ukrainian people. After the Polish-Soviet War, they seized western Galicia, rightful Ukrainian territory, from us. To the present day, they still own it, briefly interrupted by the invasion of Poland.\n\nSimilarly to us, the Poles only just got independence from the Germans. They are still weak. If we plan well and strike fast, we may continue our quest; to create a Greater Ukraine."
 BOV_roaches_rats_desc: "There were many German collaborators. They are rats, scum of the earth. Although the Vozhd and Bandera collaborated with the Nazis, they viewed it as an alliance. When the Nazis attempted to assert authority, they broke their pact with the Nazis. However, those who continue to collaborate with the Nazis are rats.\n\nHowever, some don't like the Nazis. Yet, they collaborate, fearing for their lives. These are the cockroaches, and we can easily filter them out from the rats. These roaches can be very useful to us; they have valuable experience and can be easily beaten into compliance."

Lenin never gave up on his revolution, and eventually, they overthrew the Russian Empire. Bukharin never gave up on the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa. However, for Bukharin, the outcome was quite different. Yet, the Communists will continue to live on, and one spark of hope could lead to a fire of resistance.\n\nTo prevent this, we must act quickly and decisively. We must strike, again, again, and again. If we give the Communists time to lick their wounds, we will be putting our government at risk. No matter the cost, no Communists shall gain an inch of land in Ukraine!"
 BOV_galvanize_galicians_desc: "To continue preparations for our annexation of Galicia, we must send a message to our Galician brothers. Right now, they are under Polish oppression. Soon we will liberate them, and we must establish contacts there. Perhaps they can assist us in our cause. Our success relies on the cooperation of our countrymen to resist the subcultural Polish swine."
 BOV_melnyk_vermin_desc: "After painstaking efforts from what remains of the Sluzhba Bezpeky, we have tracked down the remnants of the militant Melnykite movement, which is in Chernihiv. The faction is nothing but a shadow of its former self, now under Roman Sushko.\n\nOnce we purge the remnants of the Melnykites, we will destroy all factionalism in the OUN; once more, we will unite the OUN as one party, an occasion which merits a 'Slava Ukraini!'"
 BOV_op_golov_desc: "After meticulous planning by our officers and the Vozhd, it's ready. Operation Golovinsky, our operation to liberate Galicia, has been extensively planned. Now, the only thing separating us and reunification with our countrymen is the simple go-ahead of an order from the supreme Vozhd and Poland shall once again know our fury!"

 BOV_last_roman_desc: "On many occasions the Romans of old were rent asunder by civil war, and only by the victory of one claimant was some form of order recovered. So it is today, with Shukhevych standing atop the remains of a once-unified front, and the pillars of Klyachkivsky and Stetsko torn down.\n\nThe reins of Ukraine, of the future of the state and its people, are in his hands - and he will have to act quickly to solidify his hold. For Ukraine - and for the promises of prosperity that seem so far away."
 BOV_shattered_front_desc: "It was taken for granted that the unity once achieved by Bandera would endure among all Ukrainians. That fantasy has been shattered - at staggering cost to the people as a whole. Different militias, movements, and individuals fought each other as much as they did the invaders, and so consigned all to decline.\n\nThis must be corrected. The effort required will be truly enormous, but the rifts between these groupings must be mended and a common front established. We are all, first and foremost, whatever our differences, Ukrainian."
 BOV_insuring_insurgencies_desc: "Regardless of overtures made, the Communists and Republicans continue to fight expecting, as has happened many times in the past, their families to suffer the consequences if they are betrayed. We have no such intention, but we cannot blame them - the scars run deep.\n\nThey will not yet join us, but this does not mean we need be punitive. We can fight them as honorably as possible, treat their prisoners with respect, and peacefully occupy the lands we take from them - absent reprisals. In time, they will learn our sincerity, and join us as brothers."
 BOV_line_in_sand_desc: "No matter what we do or say, the Communists and Republicans fight on, wasting lives, effort, and resources against fellow Ukrainians instead of against those who wish us all erased. We must put a stop to this, and if we cannot outright defeat them in the field, we can at least make a deal.\n\nWe shall pledge to eschew any reprisal action against them or their families as long as they refrain from attacks on or destruction of critical infrastructure. It will be a suspicious truce, to be sure, but it will serve our needs for now - and that must be good enough."
 BOV_uneasy_truce_desc: "Though there are still skirmishes between our forces and those of our common ideological foes, they have declined in recent times owing, at least in part, to the repeated overtures of peace that have been extended by our leadership. Cautious questions have been sent to us in reply, and while it is obvious that they are using this lull to recover from the wounds we have inflicted upon them, it is at least a peace, of sorts.\n\nOnly time will tell if this 'peace' will truly last, but if we make the effort to preserve it, perhaps in time a true understanding can be reached."
 BOV_ukrainian_triumvirate_desc: "Without a doubt one of the most damaging decisions of Klyachkivsky was the over-centralization of power in only one man's hands - his own. It turned him into a tyrant, repressing any dissent, and the results were disastrous for all. We will not repeat this mistake.\n\nExecutive power will be invested in a council, and though Shukhevych will necessarily retain its chairmanship, he will not be a dictator. Checked and informed by fellow patriots, the worst excesses will be avoided, and consensus will be obtained before decisions."
 BOV_excise_excess_desc: "Shukhevych's legacy as a former collaborator is a somewhat messy one, but one more than exonerated of through his actions. Many followed with him, even before the Ukrainian Civil War, but it's no well-hidden secret that those who fled with him during and after the Civil War were certainly not well-meaning, and were only looking out for their own hides. These collaborator scum must be purged from our ranks, and doing so will come with great ease.\n\nWhile treasonous shrews like Stetsko will inevitably protest, they have hardly any say in this matter, and that point besides, their complaints will only make it easier to track down these backstabbing elements. Ukraine has no place for traitors and the criminally evil, and the former employees of Nazis are no exception."
 BOV_fractured_organization_desc: "The void of charisma and unifying presence left by the death of Konovalets has left the OUN as a bickering, infighting - often literally - mess ever since, and Shukhevych's triumph has not resolved this. Every day, disparate factions bite at each other like rabid dogs in the halls of the government, impeding operations; if we hope for our organization to stand the test of time, or even five years, this must be eliminated.\n\nNothing generates unity like justice, and, fortunately, now provides an excellent opportunity. With the defeat of the Reichskommissariat, we have an abundance trials of traitors and oppressors to be put on trial, to receive due retribution for lifetimes and lives lost, bringing true justice for the past to Ukraine.\n\nThis is far from the beginning of our efforts on unifying the OUN, and far from the beginning of a unified OUN, but even still, we must begin, or all will be lost."
 BOV_humiliate_honorless_desc: "A bureaucratic system is a spine that keeps any nation floating, so it is deeply ironic that our bureaucracy is filled with those who have none whatsoever. Leftovers from the accursed Reichskommissariat, most of the current basis of our government consists of former collaborators who managed to escape the rope during initial trials of the collaborators; most pointing to their past incompetences as proof of resistance, which they may as well have been. While this cannot be allowed to persist, we regretfully cannot outright cleanse ourselves of most of our bean-counting office workers. As a result, the solution is obvious.\n\nTo eliminate the highest ranking survivors of the purges will ensure that examples are made publicly, while parading around the rest as those who sold out their country and must be fixed to love it as they once did will allow us to ensure they are sufficiently dedicated to the cause once more. They simply do not yet know they have it in them."
 BOV_subdue_surpents_desc: "Many of those former collaborators who aided in the liberation from before the start have been exceptionally dedicated to the cause, though some were limited to collaboration as it was the only way forward for a Ukrainian state. Not their leaders, however. Those leaders who did everything to collaborate above promoting nationalism do not deserve the beat of their hearts or the breath in their lungs. Depriving them of both will prove the only way forward for Ukraine.\n\nExecuting Stsiborskyi, Stetsko, and Shandruk immediately will prove itself the greatest boon to Ukrainian nationalism since Taras Shevchenko's first writings. They will not be missed. In their absence, Ukraine will prosper, the nation will grow stronger, and political divisiveness will fade into the past. May their graves be forgotten, and the unity of the OUN stand forevermore."
 BOV_emboldening_embers_desc: "Many former collaborators were left with no choice but to follow the Melnykites to express their nationalism, but the most righteous path has revealed itself, and all were given the choice to follow it, and so they have.\n\nReunifying the OUN has come as no easy feat, but to solidify these gains we must make efforts to appeal to their total support. No organization such as ours can fully function without total cooperation, and we are certain these initially more avid collaborators will be able to offer such - or will prove themselves useful in other ways. The OUN now stands taller than ever, perhaps even now rivalling the age of Konovalets, and we could never be prouder of it."
 BOV_score_unsettled_desc: "Galicia has always been Ukrainian, no matter the endless Polish ethnic cleansing efforts since the tragedy of their war with the Russians in the '20s. Ever since, the Piedmont of Ukraine has remained seperate from its nation, and regardless of whatever throwaway promises the Germans made to the Melnykite traitors they saw no reason to change this situation. As such, with the overthrow of the Generalgouvernment, the Poles still hold half of Ukraine, and our homes, families, and people still rest under their thumb. It is high time we bring Galicia home.\n\nThe Poles will obviously not be grateful for the deal we are offering them, but for all their oppressions of our people in the past, it is more than generous enough.\n\nThe Poles will return our rightful lands.\n\n§ROr their blood will water our land before we return.§!"

 BOV_fortune_infamous_desc: "At every level, and at every obstacle that the Vozhd faced, people said that he could not overcome them. 'Stetsko will fail this time' was a thought widely shared. But he never did - and never will. The actions taken to secure ultimate power have inspired rage, hatred, and plotting against him, but he will solve all of these, in time.\n\nThe odds have always been against him, both internally and externally, and yet fortune's favor cannot be denied. The Vozhd will endure this trial as well. As he always has."
 BOV_yaroslav_wisdom_desc: "Whereas others in Ukraine focus on the immediate, Stetsko looks beyond. Towards history, both past and future. Emulating Yaroslav the Wise, he sees the larger picture and how, regardless of recent events, the real enemy of millenia past are the Russo-Mongolian hordes.\n\nGermany, for all its many failings, won a great victory against them for the Aryan race and for the European peoples, and this cannot be understated. Taking this wisdom, Stetsko will carefully guide the ship of state, and bring Ukraine to stand as an equal with its contemporaries."
 BOV_twist_dagger_desc: "The mighty Vozhd was forced to make unfortunate deals and compromises to seize our independent state's reigns. The underhanded and covert nature of these efforts has seen disgruntled voices in our movement make startling comparisons between our Vozhd and the Jewish parasites that defiled our homeland. This is unacceptable! The wise Stestko represents a new future for the Aryans of Ukraine, and like a true Aryan, he shall triumph over all who question his reign."
 BOV_streets_rage_desc: "Even after all that our nation has been through, marching through blood, sweat, and tears from decades of warfare with Bolshevism and traitors, our country remains polluted. The Slavic-Mongol bands of Poles and Russians, now free of their imprisonments, scour the countryside in roving bands, causing disorder and terror. Enough is enough; we shall remind these scum of their place in Ukraine, even if we have to commit some terrors of our own!"
 BOV_reassure_settlers_desc: "Since the end of the Reichskommissariat and our force's triumph in the civil war, our Aryan brethren amongst the settlers have watched us with a growing sense of dread and paranoia, doubtlessly beset by fear of treasonous psychopaths like Klyachkivsky. Fear not, beloved cousins! We are not madmen, traitors, or degenerates, but fellow Aryans and model Ukrainians, and there is nothing to fear..."
 BOV_media_blackout_desc: "The Jews that control the media within America and its decadent vessels have smelt blood. The troubles within Germany have given them newfound motivation to sneak their degenerate values into the minds of anyone no longer shielded by German censors. Ukrainians are unfortunately no exception.\n\nIn order to prevent the degradation of our values caused by this onslaught of Jewish propaganda, Ukraine must double its censorship efforts and flood the airwaves to counter any and all liberal and communist influence. If our newfound state is to survive for any time, our people's minds must be free of any corruptive influence."
 BOV_our_bloodlands_await_desc: "Galicia is Ukrainian - It always has been, and it always will be. Whether it was ruled by Poles, Austrians, Russians or Poles again did not change this fact. Those Poles who still occupy Galicia may try to deny this and deny us our homes. If they do not relinquish territory, we will have to remind them of our legitimate claim.\n\nThe Germans seem somewhat convinced of our right to Galicia, giving Ukrainians autonomy within the Polish Administration. In addition, both Bandera and Shukhevych have made efforts in the past to cleanse the land. It could take only one final push to see Galicia populated wholly by Ukranains and to see no Pole or any other race haunt these lands again."

 #civil war events
 
 BOV.1.t: "Chaos in the Streets"
 BOV.1.d: "The poster was full of hope. Filled dreams of liberation from the Nazi order. Filled with dreams of a strong, free future. The poster depicted the Brotherhood, Klyachkivsky, the Citizenry, and the Soldiers each grabbing an arm of the swastika and ripping it into quarters, with the message "Our Right to be Free" in the center. But Roman was skeptical. How could the Brotherhood free Ukraine from the Nazis when it cannot even save its own streets from chaos?\n\nEvery day, there was a riot, a bombing, or a lynching in the streets. Going out to do an errand without some sort of protection was a guaranteed way to get brutally beaten and robbed of all possessions. The streets were anarchic, and the Brotherhood was doing nothing to fix the situation. Instead, the men sat in their high castle, ordering civilians to die pointless deaths for their vile cause. They rode out on the street in armored trucks, capturing minorities like Jews and Poles, to lynch them with the rest of the mobs. Roman's face contorted in disgust.\n\nSuddenly, the poster became a source of pain to Roman, as if looking at it set a torch directly to his soul. He grasped the poster and tore it down from the wall in a moment of uncontrolled hatred and anger. He breathed heavily. Then, Roman quickly walked away, knowing that if a loyalist had seen what he did, he would be next on the Brotherhood's purge list."
 BOV.1.a: "The unconvinced in our land will soon be silenced."
 
 BOV.2.t: "The Farmer and the Brotherhood"
 BOV.2.d: "Petro Poltavets stared at the men in black uniforms trespassing on his farm. Even from 70 meters away, he could sense their malevolence rolling off of them in waves. As they approached, he felt an almost animalistic instinct telling him to turn back and flee, to save himself from whatever horrors the men in black were going to show him. But, if there was something Petro was known for, it was his courage, and so he held his ground and let the men approach him.\n\nAs the men got closer, one of them looked at the list in his hands.\n\n"Slava Ukraini! We are with the Brotherhood of Volyn. You are Petro Poltavets of the Poltavets Farmstead, correct?"\n\n"You would be right," Petro replied calmly, trying not to reveal the fear he felt. The Brotherhood of Volyn? They were extremist terrorists! What were they doing here?\n\n"Good. I am glad to inform you that you will now be fighting on the front lines for the liberation of Ukraine. You are expected to lay down your life for your motherland. Do I make myself clear?"\n\nPetro's eyes widened in disbelief. He was being conscripted to fight for terrorists!\n\n"Listen, you terrorist bastards, I will fight for Ukraine on my own terms! I will not be press-ganged into your-"\n\nHis sentence was cut short by the second man, who smashed the butt of his pistol over Petro's now-unconscious head. The man with the list looked at his comrade and said,\n\n"Grab him and put him in the truck.""
 BOV.2.a: ""He will soon know obedience to the Brotherhood well enough.""
 
 BOV.3.t: "Fallen Prayers"
 BOV.3.d: "The factory's innards were stinking, putrid, and hotter than Huttig's Afrika on a bright summer day. If only the workers could see the natural light outside, that is. The factory was its own closed microcosm of Hell, with the workers inside treated as nothing more than battered, overheated pieces of meat made to produce more guns, more tools, and more parts on a daily basis.\n\nMykhailo was one of those workers, sore, stinking, and desperate for food and water. His arms felt like they were going to fall off, and his lungs felt like they were going to collapse from the amount of heated fumes he was inhaling. But he could not stop, not even for a second, lest the guards see him. He kept fitting the firing pin into the receiver, firing pin into the receiver, firing pin into the receiver, over and over for at least 16 hours a day.\n\nBut Mykhailo could not scream, nor could he cry. He could only make guns for the damnable Brotherhood to help in their plans to ruin Ukraine. But there was something he could do, something not even the ever-vigilant Brotherhood guards could notice. He could silently pray. Pray for his survival, pray for Ukraine's well-being, and pray for the destruction of the Brotherhood and the Germans. But as the days dragged on, with the work hours longer and longer, Mykhailo feared his prayers had fallen on deaf ears."
 BOV.3.a: "For prayers alone could not destroy the Germans."

 BOV.4.t: "And the Women, Too"
 BOV.4.d: "Maryna stared at the gun in her hands for a long, long time. She had no idea how to use it, or how it worked. She had never even held a gun before this! She even told it to the Brotherhood recruiters, too! And yet they took her from her home anyway, a conscript about to be sent to the front lines to die fighting real soldiers. Jesus, Maryna thought, she was going to be fighting real soldiers with real combat experience, while her regiment was so underequipped that she didn't even have combat shoes! Maryna quaked with fear.This is it, she thought. This is where my story ends.\n\nMaryna ran a little farm, about thirty minutes from Zhytomyr. She had taken over control after her father and brothers all perished fighting the Germans in the second world war. She led a lonely but satisfactory life. She was lucky enough to not be enslaved by the Germans, and their presence in Ukraine did not meaningfully affect her life. This, of course, all changed when the men in black appeared at her doorstep, telling her about "Ukraine's glorious liberation," and how it was her duty to fight for it.\n\nNow, Maryna felt like she was going to die from fear before she ever had to fight a German. Before she ever had to fight a fellow Ukrainian. Maryna shuddered at the thought. She was going to be killing her own countrymen. Or be killed by them. She put down her rifle. She could not bear to keep it in her hands any longer. It would soon be picked up from her corpse by the enemy anyway."
 BOV.4.a: "All people, regardless of gender, must fight for Ukraine!"

 BOV.5.t: "Ash"
 BOV.5.d: "Yevhen's old bones and joints were sore from a combination of age, military service, and arthritis, but he still kept moving. He had to lead his grandchildren somewhere safe, somewhere far away from the Brotherhood of Volyn, and possibly even far away from Ukraine itself. He could still smell the ashes of his entire hometown after they were engulfed in flames. He could smell all of the seventy years of memories destroyed in the instant the blaze was lit. That night, and all of the nights since, he cried. Cried for the memories lost. Cried for the sanctuary he had built with his two hands being ruined as if it was nothing of any significance. Cried for the ashes of his wife being further desecrated by the ever hungry fire.\n\nHe recalled when they had given him the order to evacuate his house. A man dressed in uniform, Captain Voloshyn, gave him five minutes for him and his grandchildren to gather essential supplies before leaving. The Captain announced that they were burning the entire town down, and that Yevhen and his family would be forced out by gunpoint if they did not comply. And so Yevhen gave in. He wanted to put up a fight, to defend what was rightfully his, but he recognized the futility of it. So he told his grandchildren to gather everything they needed and nothing more, and they quickly fled the town. When Larysa and Pavlo asked him why they left, his mouth became dry. He could not bring himself to look his grandchildren in the eyes. He simply dragged them along with him.\n\nThe exhaustion of his joints and limbs quickly dragged Yevhen back to the present. He could run no further. He stopped Larysa and Pavlo, and they rested for the night. In the morning they would keep running. They could never get far enough away from their paradise lost."
 BOV.5.a: "Was it all necessary?"

 BOV.6.t: "A Night in the Warehouse"
 BOV.6.d: "Dmytro, Yuri, and Vasyl stared at the warehouse after a long day of walking to Kyiv. They had ducked and weaved past countless German patrols and through waves upon waves of artillery fire, and yet they felt intimidated by a warehouse. Vasyl took a second to scope out as many possible entrances to the warehouse as he could find. No windows. Of course.\n\nVasyl sighed heavily. "God damn, no windows. Looks like we're headed straight through the front door."\n\n"What? Are you nuts, Vasyl? That's gonna get us all killed!"\n\n"Shit, Yuri, quiet down! Vasyl's right. It's the only way into the warehouse. Besides, it's probably unguarded anyway. You remember how many German soldiers we sneaked past? We probably went past their entire army! We'll be fine," Dmytro replied. "We get in, we blow it up, we get out. It's a 20 minute mission."\n\nYuri steeled himself. He couldn't be a coward, not when they already made it this far!\n\n"Right, right. You're right. We can do this. The end is right here, for God's sake! Come on, let's get this over with."\n\nVasyl stepped up first and grabbed the door handle. He turned it, pushed on the door... and nothing. No hurried words in that disgusting language, German. No German rats standing there, ready to be slaughtered like sheep. Nothing.\n\nVasyl looked back. "It's clear! Let's get this done and over with."\n\nThirty minutes later, a blinding flash alerted the Germans that something was terribly wrong at their warehouse. By the time they got there, however, it was already too late."
 BOV.6.a: "Another successful mission pulled off by our brave operatives!"
 
 BOV.7.t: "The Railroad"
 BOV.7.d: "Hrihoriy clutched the explosives in his hand tightly, as if they would suddenly jump out and run away into the distant horizon. He suppressed a yawn, careful to not alert any more Germans that could be nearby. While he had already slit the throats of all of the Germans he found at the railroad, he could never be too careful on missions like this. This particular railroad was an important supply junction, connected to all of the cities in the surrounding area, which were all heavily fortified front-line towns. It was all the more important that Hrihoriy completed his mission successfully.\n\nHrihoriy crouched, moving silently towards his target, vigilantly watching for any enemy troops that happened to stumble by. He dropped down quickly onto the railroad and began to lay the explosives. After he was done laying the sixth explosive device, he heard a sound that made his heart sink into his stomach.\n\nHe heard a wild and panicked German voice, presumably crying out for any comrades he could find. Suddenly, he heard shots from the German luger whizzing past his head, and Hrihoriy bolted away from the railway junction. He heard more German voices coming around, and he knew what he had to do. His objective. He whipped the detonator out from his pocket, and pressed the button. A deafening BOOM echoed for miles and miles, most definitely alerting everyone in the area. And so Hrihoriy kept running, satisfied in the knowledge that even if he were caught and killed, he'd done some major damage to the enemy's supply lines. He grinned."
 BOV.7.a: "A devastating blow to the enemy's supplies!"

 BOV.8.t: "Order 439"
 BOV.8.d: "[ROOT.Capital.GetName], Order Number 439, issued [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong].\n\nThe war of liberation against the traitors of the UNRA, the Bolsheviks of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, and the tyrants of the Reichskommissariat and the Volksdirektorat has gone for far too long to the Brotherhood's dismay. Reports have shown that fighting still continues on all fronts, with no end in sight. Fighting ranges from large-scale front operations against the Wehrmacht, to small skirmishes within the countryside against disorganized enemy forces. Reports have also shown that the national stockpile of food and ammunition for the soldiers are slowly running out at an alarming rate.\n\nThe citizens of Ukraine, who have shown considerable support for the fighters and willingness to sacrifice for the Brotherhood, have also started to doubt if our cause was really worth their struggle and effort.\n\nTherefore, every man, woman, and even child, if they are of sufficient health and soundness, both mentally and physically, are to fight for Ukraine with their lives. Commanders and Generals are encouraged and obliged to send the men into the front in droves for a final offensive against enemy forces. When tactics are of no use, the soldiers will charge forwards without care for their lives, only caring for the liberation of Ukraine. Those that disobey orders, execute them at will for the crime of deserting from the army.\n\nAny sign of weakness is to be eliminated from the ranks. We have to be ready to give everything for Ukraine.\n\nFor the goal of liberation, we shall now adopt the slogan..."

UPA_CivilWar.1.t: "Sparks of the National Revolution"
UPA_CivilWar.1.d: "Klyachkivsky stood on the makeshift podium, a crowd surrounding him. He felt a pang of disappointment as so few people were there to witness him. Still, this speech isn't just for those who stand with him now; it is for all of Ukraine and with the scavenged recording equipment hastily assembled before him. It would be one that would resonate for decades to come.\n\n"I come before you today to speak of the great struggle ahead. For too long, our beloved Ukraine has been under the oppressive rule of the Nazi invaders. But thanks to the valiant efforts of the UPA, we have finally been able to shake off their shackles and begin the reclamation of our nation.\n\nBut make no mistake, our fight is far from over. The Germans, weakened though they may be, still threaten our continued freedom and independence. The liberals and communists - those who fostered the weakness and depravity that caused our nation to fall, still have gripped the minds of many of our countrymen. And so, we must prepare ourselves for the next stage of this war - a war of attrition, a war of survival.\n\nWe must summon all our strength and courage and draw upon the great spirit of our people. For we are of a superior stock, descended from the great warriors and heroes of our past. We have the will and the determination to overcome any obstacle that stands in our way.\n\nAnd we must be ready to face our foes once more, take back what is rightfully ours, and crush their futile attempts at resistance. We must show them that we are not to be underestimated and that their threats or weapons will not scare us. We must be united in this fight, for it is only through our unity that we can hope to emerge victorious. So let us stand together, brothers, and show the world what it means to be Ukrainian."

UPA_CivilWar.2.t: "On Your Toes"
UPA_CivilWar.2.d: "Emerging from the forests, a group of UNRA soldiers had scouted a small village. Seemingly empty of any partisan activity, they cautiously crossed the perimeter. Their weapons are still at the ready. The streets were eerily quiet, and they couldn't help but let their guard down.\n\nA mistake that would cost them dearly.\n\nAs they entered the town square, a car bomb exploded, sending debris flying in every direction. One of the soldiers was killed instantly, and the rest were left stunned and disoriented.\n\nFrom the shadows, UPA partisans emerged, already firing. The UNRA soldiers fought back valiantly, but they were outnumbered and outmatched. One by one, they fell to the partisan's bullets.\n\nDead silence descended upon the town once again, as the lifeless bodies of the UNRA soldiers litter the streets."
UPA_CivilWar.2.a: "Returned to what it once was."

UPA_CivilWar.3.t: "The Cost of Freedom"
UPA_CivilWar.3.d: "Anton found himself knelt on the forest floor, his hands tied behind his back and his eyes closed - Surrounded by several UPA partisans, all pointing their guns at him. He can hear the sound of the wind rustling through the trees and the distant noises of the nearby city.\n\nOne of the captors steps forward, his face twisted into a perverted smile. He raised his gun and pointed it directly at the man's head. Anton opens his eyes and looks up at him, his expression calm and unafraid.\n\n"Any last words?" the captor snarls.\n\nAnton didn't say anything. Instead, he just leant forward as if he was to embrace his end. The captor hesitates for a moment, confused and concerned. He thinks the man is trying to attack him, and he panics.\n\nThe other captors followed suit, firing their guns randomly at the man. The bullets tear through his body, killing him instantly. It was a crude execution, one that did not match the strong orderly standards that those in the UPA aspired to, still - it was one less partisan all the same."
UPA_CivilWar.3.a: "And one more partisan they'd soon forget."

UPA_CivilWar.4.t: "To Kill a Hero"
UPA_CivilWar.4.d: "The head of the snake, leader of the UNRA, Yuriy Horlis, had finally fallen into the UPA's hands. His end would further fracture the liberal forces and cement the dominance of the Banderite movement over the nation.\n\nInto the forest they led him, and forced him onto the ground. The executioner looked into Yuriy's eyes, as he looked back - unshaken by his imminent doom. There was a mutual understanding between the two - Yuriy was too important to be treated as if he was worth a proper execution in front of a traumatized crowd. He would be a martyr, and his courage would humiliate the UPA.\n\nAnd so, in a quick, cold and calculated decision, Yuriy was shot before a word could be said. His body thrown into an unmarked grave, left to rot in the forest unnoticed."
UPA_CivilWar.4.a: "And so the legend ends, with a bang and a whimper."

UPA_CivilWar.5.t: "Remaking the Social Order"
UPA_CivilWar.5.d: "Every villager was packed into the town square. They had been summoned to hear a speech from a UPA official assigned to overlook the newly conquered town. Some in the crowd looked on in curiosity, others frightened or disinterested.\n\nThe man spoke of the insurgent army's power, its ability to bring strength and security to Ukrainians, Free from the boot of the Nazis, the tyranny of the communists and the disorder of the liberals. Many in the crowd, while forced to be there, took an interest in what the man was saying. He rambled on for some time. More and more of the crowd being hypnotized by his words.\n\nNothing of what he said seemed particularly controversial, and it felt natural as the man eventually started ranting about the "superiority of Ukrainian blood" and the need to rid the country of "inferior" elements.\n\nSome townsfolk exchanged worried glances, while others continued to watch. As the speech continued, the UPA leader called for a show of solidarity, and the crowd began to chant "Slava Ukraini!" in unison. Some looked on in horror as friends and neighbors embraced the rhetoric of their former occupiers. Others felt glee in knowing that now it would be Ukrainians who would be put first. But to those that did not match the idealized image of the pure Ukrainian man - they shuddered at the prospect of the Nazi ideology long outlasting its German creators."
UPA_CivilWar.5.a: "New boss, same as the old boss."

UPA_CivilWar.6.t: "A Final Minute"
UPA_CivilWar.6.d: "The office was quiet, far too quiet for working hours. At first, Ivanko was certain no one had come in today. Then he noticed the drinks left on countertops, the papers strewn around the secretary's desk. At first, it seemed unusual, but not impossible. Ivanko and his comrades were UNRA men, now trapped in a UPA world. Ivanko knew the paper was bound to shutter eventually.\n\nBut why would they disband without telling him?\n\nAfter glancing across the room, Ivanko noticed two men in the printer's room. He couldn't tell who they were - strangers, clearly. They were reading next week's issue, drawing on the pages and talking to each other.\n\nOne of the men, the taller, had a gun on his back. And as Ivanko looked closer, he could see bands of red and black around his shoulder.\n\nThen, Ivanko noticed the crimson stain in the hardwood. In a few places, it even seemed wet.\n\nThe journalist turned around, hoping to run back to his home, praying that his name had been lost in the chaos. He didn't see that one soldier had already turned his head towards Ivanko, and was slinging his rifle from his shoulder."
UPA_CivilWar.6.a: "Ivanko joined his comrades moments later."

UPA_CivilWar.7.t: "The Factory of Damocles"
UPA_CivilWar.7.d: "Ivan, the UPA's new foreman of Vinnytsia Heavy Appliances, stared out through his office window towards lines of workers, humming away at their stations. He held a glass of German wine to his lips, and drank deeply. As the wine fell into his stomach, he cursed the commander who had named him the foreman. How could that man see Ivan as fit for this curse?\n\nThe cloud hanging over Ivan's factory was one of expertise. The UPA had appointed him based on "experience", but experience meant nothing to a factory line. Before the UPA came, Ivan was merely a slave to the Germans, knowing only of his single station. The true knowledge of this factory laid in the brains of the engineers and foremans, pushed in front of a firing squad and then splattered on the southward wall.\n\nIn other words, if anything in this factory broke, Ivan had no answers.\n\nFor now, Ivan was a hero to the UPA. But if the factory faced an accident, if a machine broke down, if even the electricity went out, Ivan would no longer be viewed so kindly. He'd be investigated for treason, mismanagement, and conspiracy against his nation. And really, that could only end one way.\n\nIvan had tried to convince himself a better outcome was possible. Maybe a promotion could come faster than an accident. Maybe Ivan would find enough time to escape. But either relied on the factory running smoothly, for even a month or so. And Aryan factories relied on a certain level of... Ukrainian expendability.\n\nIvan tasted the wine on his lips. If this was to be his last drink, he'd picked a fine wine to go out on."
UPA_CivilWar.7.a: "He spent the rest of the day finishing the bottle."

UPA_CivilWar.8.t: "Simple Pleasures"
UPA_CivilWar.8.d: "August was not the type of person to complain; such talk did not make a good soldier. He was not like his comrades in the great war against Bolshevism who complained of poor rations and the never ending mud. No, August took these trials in stride. The iron crosses hung upon his office wall once stood as a testament to that. "Ah, nostalgia". He mentally chided himself - that too was a sign of weakness.\n\nAugust's work was never below average, so he was rarely shouted at by the guards, but his lazy good for nothing they deigned to call his co-workers couldn't shine a shell casing to save their lives.\n\nOne of the guards shouted behind him. "FASTER FASTER, if you wish to eat some time today FASTER!".\n\nAugust didn't jump. He could feel the guard stomp off in defeat. He had a spine of iron and no teenager with a rifle could bend it. He returned to his work. He polished the cases, making them shine. A minute later there was the next batch, and his work was no less pristine. The next batch simply couldn't be cleaned; no matter what he did, a reddish-brown stain just seemed to saturate the case further. He began to grumble about stupid workers trying to cut themselves to get out of work, but he noticed a slight pain in his thumb. It was profusely bleeding. He sucked it and returned to his work.\n\nAugust never really had "breaks". Only short periods were food was practically thrown at him and he was given a few short minutes to wolf it down before returning to the assembly line. As he ate his gruel, he noted his compatriots. They were shifty eyed, bald men, whose eyes were all turned downward in an animalistic effort to the food in their bowl, or prowling the floor for scraps. August knew these men, if not by name, or face, then by countenance. He had overseen them for years, he had heard their mumblings about freedom and German tyrants and all other such things, and yet here they stayed."
UPA_CivilWar.8.a: "Forever with him."

UPA_CivilWar.9.t: "Requiem Bells"
UPA_CivilWar.9.d: ""It is my opinion, friends, that our crusade is not yet complete. Not in the slightest! We may have liberated our nation from the Teutonic yoke, crushed the Bolshevists, and seen our flag rise from the Don to Volyn, but we have yet to truly see all of Ukraine out from under the foreign boot. It remains pressed upon our necks as we cast weary eyes towards Germany, as we watch our people cower before the thought of their bombs, as we pray for mercy from the foreign enemy..."\n\nYaroslav Stetsko sat at rapt attention, faces, and knuckles pale. This was it, there was no turning back. He knew this was coming, deep down. He remembered the furious campsite declarations, the frenzied murmurings, he even foggily remembered those maps on the peeled, faded propaganda posters displayed on forgotten town billboards, and what they had promised.\n\n"...Who are they? Those traitors, those backbiters, those doubters? Why some sit among us!"\nStetsko stared ahead, his face turning almost yellow. Dear god just utter the words, end this damned experiment. Perhaps the Germans would make his death short.\n\n"We march soon. Our armies are ready. The blood of our people cries out for justice for those who so unjustly spilled it. The honor and sanctity of Ukraine will never be preserved unless we go south, to reclaim our peninsula! The national flag shall fly above Sevastopol!".\n\nThey all cheered, as Dymtro Klyachkivsky sank to his seat, his face emotionless."
UPA_CivilWar.9.a: "The bell hath tolled."

UPA_CivilWar.10.t: "Victory, Total and Unquestionable"
UPA_CivilWar.10.d: "All of them had been wrong. All of them had doubted him. All of them lacked ambition, drive, and true patriotism. Only he, Dymtro Klyachkivsky would go down in history as the liberator of the Crimea! His march through Sevastopol would be remembered just as Scipio's triumph! Only he had truly achieved Bandera's dream!\n\nThe streets of the city lay in ruins. Rubble stood where once the Teutonic monoliths had clouded the skies, while mud permeated where sumptuous, decadent parks once ambled along. Shukhevych stared blankly at it all.\n\n"We won! Only a few years ago we thought the day would never come!"\n\nKlyachkivsky slapped Shukhevych on the back, nearly knocking him off-balance.\n\n"I suppose," he said blankly.\n\n"You suppose?" Klyachkivsky sighed, chuckling slightly.\n\n"There are still Germans here and in the countryside. We haven't cleared all of the garrisons yet, and the Tatars aren't pleased. I have already heard reports of insurrection in the Yalu..." "And they shall be crushed!" Klyachkivsky snapped, his predatory grin fading slightly. "They have nothing here anymore. Their estates will be parceled out, some of the soldiers have already brought their families, and the Tatars can be bought off with some of them as well. The garrisons will wither."\n\n"You worry too much."\n\nKlyachkivsky turned, gazing out at the harbor. At least he had come, unlike Stetsko. Stetsko was too busy whimpering in Kyiv."
UPA_CivilWar.10.a: "They know not of victory, even when standing amidst it."

### Fraternal Coup events ###

BOV_fraternal_coup.1.t: "Stetsko's Gambit"
BOV_fraternal_coup.1.d: ""Damn his lack of sense!" Stetsko sputtered as he stumbled around his office, gathering paper for his typewriter. The usually composed man had become fraught with nervous meltdowns since Klyachkivsky had ordered the assault on Crimea, and his victory had only driven the visionary further into erratic fervor.\n\n"His lack of restraint will certainly get us all killed," Rebet added. Stress did not treat the man kindly, as sweat drenched his bald head with an anxious sheen.\n\n"If the Vozhd is going to act like a rabid animal, then he should be put down," Lebed coldly added with a sneer. "It's becoming harder to hide my tracks; soon enough, he'll have our heads."\n\n"Which is precisely why I've summoned both of you here," Stetsko exclaimed as he began to type furiously. "There will be no peace and no Ukraine should we sit idly and let a false destiny claim our lives." The typewriter's rapid clicks filled the silence as Stetsko's voice began to crescendo. "Only two paths lie before us. One to an early grave, and one to a glorious victory. Just as Bandera challenged Melnyk's wicked corruption, so too must we purge our ranks of a Vozhd whose ambitions betray our ideals." Stetsko removed the page from the typewriter and handed it to Rebet. "Deliver this to Maivsky without delay."\n\n"And what would you have me do?" Lebed inquired.\n\n"Monitor our dear Vozhd. I trust you know what to do when the opportunity arises," Stetsko responded with a sardonic grin."
BOV_fraternal_coup.1.a: "And thus, Mephisto began his waltz."

BOV_fraternal_coup.2.t: "Brothers of Defiance"
BOV_fraternal_coup.2.d: "Highly respected general,\n\nI must congratulate you on your triumphant liberation of our dear Ukraine. Through your martial prowess, our people can finally embrace the freedom robbed from them for four decades. God has looked down favorably on your command, and I pray that he continues to bless your path.\n\nI must also confess that I do not write to you with honest intentions but with those of a deceitful brigand. I regret that it has come to this, but the actions of the Vozhd threaten the future you have won for our nation. Yaroslav is formulating a plan to liberate us from the Vozhd's tyrannical gaze once and for all, and so I write to you, dear friend, to inform you of our plight.\n\nI'm aware that asking you to commit treason against the nation you have just freed betrays your principles, but I hope that within your heart you will see the righteousness of our cause. If my request is too demanding, then I implore you to pretend that this letter does not exist for the sake of your men. I will pray for the safety and health of you and your family in these turbulent times. Ukraine needs every hero it has; I only ask that you not abandon her now in her time of great need.\n\nWith true respect,\n\nL. Rebet"
BOV_fraternal_coup.2.a: "An earnest plea reaches opportunistic eyes."

BOV_fraternal_coup.3.t: "The Patrician's Play"
BOV_fraternal_coup.3.d: ""A plot to overthrow the Vozhd? It's not often we get to follow in Bandera's footsteps," Kuk muttered with a sarcastic drone.\n\n"An opportunity to do as Bandera did is a rare occasion indeed," Pozychanyuk chimed in with a wry smile, "and it would be a waste to squander Rebet's friendship."\n\n"Drop the treasonous talk," Shukhevych growled. "You shouldn't fall for such honeyed words either. Stetsko is the mastermind behind this scheme; it's entirely possible that Lev has become another one of his puppets." Truthfully, Shukhevych did not know what to do with the letter. He had considered torching it without saying a word; that would've been the correct choice, and yet he summoned his advisors for their input. "I will remind all of you once that as officers of the army, you are to maintain discipline at all times."\n\n"I apologize; I should not have allowed my eagerness to cloud my judgment," Pozychanyuk replied.\n\n"However," Kuk interjected, "his point is valid; if there was ever a chance to force the Vozhd to reform or resign, this is it." Shukhevych could not deny his subordinate's observations. Perhaps he summoned them to validate a feeling he had denied? Strong men follow their desires and seize what rightfully belongs to them. Would he allow himself to be subordinated to a weasel to escape the illogical wrath of a feral animal? No. He would not be sidelined again.\n\n"Perhaps I was too quick to judge your words as treason," Shukhevych said. "It wouldn't be our fault if word of the Vozhd's fall reached us too late after all.""
BOV_fraternal_coup.3.a: "A third joins the devil's dance."

BOV_fraternal_coup.4.t: "The Outlander"
BOV_fraternal_coup.4.d: "Klyachkivsky looked at the great city of Kyiv from his window. The edifices that sprawled before him were distorted by his own tired reflection. Klyachkivsky could not help but stare at the specter that stared back at him from the window. His eyes, ringed by darkness, bore into his very psyche as the weight of many sleepless nights crushed his consciousness. Was this ancient man, this walking husk in the mirror, really him? Of course. Was it not what he deserved for his weakness that allowed the UPA to be subverted from within?\n\nThe rising sun's accusatory glare burst through the window, momentarily blinding the Vozhd. As the stars left Klyachkivsky's withered eyes, he could only gaze upon the shining city outside his window. Kyiv, such a glorious and ancient city, conquered by foreigners yet never truly lost to the Ukrainian people, was alien to him. The gleaming optimism of the warm city outside his office had not once been felt by the Vozhd, who had lurked in the damp thickets and hillocks of Galicia for nearly fifteen years. The starving bogs that could swallow men whole were naught but a memory, and yet the unknown city expanse before him was equally overwhelming.\n\nIt was unacceptable, Klyachkivsky thought to himself, that a Vozhd could ever be unfamiliar with the crown jewel of his great nation. So, the Vozhd donned his coat and called for his bodyguard. A tour was in order for the city's greatest liberator."
BOV_fraternal_coup.4.a: "And so the Vozhd began to open his heart. Pathetic."

BOV_fraternal_coup.5.t: "Duplicity Duped"
BOV_fraternal_coup.5.d: "As Klyachkivsky returned to the headquarters, he could sense the change in atmosphere. Through the expressions on the faces of the (more numerous guards). On the sudden speed with which his driver raced through the gates.\n\nExiting his vehicle, he loudly demanded to know what had happened, and as the hard faces of the soldiers gave way to the shaken visage of Lenkavskyi, he obtained his answer. There had been an attack, and had things gone only slightly differently, the building would have been occupied by insurrectionists rather than loyal guards.\n\nExplaining the timeline of the assault, Lenkavskyi described the sudden attempt at storming and capture that had been made. He rushed through the desperate defense then explained the eventual victory - and the capture of some of the attackers, miserable men now huddled at gunpoint in the corner of the courtyard. Under his harsh interrogation, they admitted the identity of their master - Stetsko.\n\nAt that, Klyachkivsky silently nodded, and turned. As he walked away, several guards brought rope with which to form a makeshift noose around a lamppost. The unfortunate attackers would no doubt be the first of many hoisted as such."
BOV_fraternal_coup.5.a: "A close call, indeed."

BOV_fraternal_coup.6.t: "The Trapped Weasel"
BOV_fraternal_coup.6.d: "The nondescript exterior of the small building, tucked away on a quiet side street, belied the importance of the events that had been set in motion within it.\n\nAt a small table behind the barred door sat a table, and around that table sat three men who had put their plan into motion. Klyachkivsky had to fall, they all knew, if they were to secure the future of Ukraine, and though many events had been set into motion the one most important - Klyachkivsky's actual death - had yet to succeed, and had yet to return any information from those assigned to it at all.\n\nThe arguments between Stetsko, Rebet, and Lebed started quietly, but grew quickly in earnest. Had it occurred? Had it been foiled? Were there oversights in the plan? Surely not, Stetsko worked to assure the others. They just had to be patient, and keep confidence.\n\nThat confidence was soon shattered by the sound of trucks arriving, and the harsh shouting of orders from both the front and rear of the building. Moments later the door shattered inward, and as the soldiers rushed in, quickly arresting all three of them, the answer was definitively given.\n\nAs he was being led away (to a fate he could well imagine), Stetsko could not for the life of him understand what had gone wrong. Had someone talked? Been turned weeks ago? Or was it a simple coincidence, a right turn instead of a left?\n\nHe imagined he would never know."
BOV_fraternal_coup.6.a: "He was right."

BOV_fraternal_coup.7.t: "A Deep Cleanse"
BOV_fraternal_coup.7.d: "In the aftermath of Stetsko's attempt at coup, the many generals of the UPA - especially those who had not been entirely aligned behind Klyachkivsky - had been summoned to headquarters. There was no room for dissent or delay, they all knew, not now. Not while they were being watched.\n\nDespite extreme levels of security, the mood in the assembly room was nervous in the extreme - for none knew, or could say with any certainty, how involved anyone else had been in the attempt. When Klyachkivsky himself entered and began his speech, the mood darkened even further, and with rapidity.\n\nHe railed against the treason of Stetsko, and began reading names of those whose involvement had been 'discovered.' With each name came strong arms pulling them away, out and away from the room. The list went on, and the more politically aware among the leadership realized that beyond purging Stetsko's confederates, Klyachkivsky was also removing anyone he had suspicions about. He now had the political capital, and was using it decisively.\n\nSome of the names were expected, but when Shukhevych and his closest allies were identified, the room went silent. For a moment all thought there was to be violence, but more guards entered and, grossly outnumbered, they had no alternative but to surrender. As he left under guard, those that remained understood the threat well. There would be no further dissent permitted - of any kind."
BOV_fraternal_coup.7.a: "Another threat removed."

BOV_fraternal_coup.8.t: "Triumph of the Vozhd"
BOV_fraternal_coup.8.d: "Although the morning in question was not particularly cold, those in attendance were chilled to the bone. Almost overnight, and in the aftermath of Stetsko's coup attempt, the entire political order of the UPA had been overturned. Factionalism, or at least factionalism against Klyachkivsky, was to end today. With the end of those who had been leading it. The gallows had been assembled the night before, sturdily built and prepared to hold their imminent burden for many nights to come. For many examples to be set.\n\nThe guards arrived first, followed by those ranking members of the UPA who had been deemed 'loyal' to Shukhevych. Arranged in careful squares - and watched, they noticed, by hard-eyed and well-armed soldiers - they awaited the arrival of the other groups. One by one they came. First the Vozhd's confidantes and most trustworthy officers. Then the Vozhd himself, taking a place of prominence. And then, finally, the condemned, to a one looking intentionally pathetic in the sackcloth they had been given.\n\nThe event itself was swift. The charges were read out as Stetsko, Shukhevych, and many others were led forward and placed on the gallows, the nooses tightened. With only a single nod from Klyachkivsky the lever was pulled, the figures dropped, and the sharp crack of breaking bones echoed through the square.\n\nThe bodies were left hanging as the forced crowd departed. They would not be taken down for many weeks."
BOV_fraternal_coup.8.a: "Absolute control."

BOV_fraternal_coup.9.t: "A Perfect Kill"
BOV_fraternal_coup.9.d: "As the vehicle rumbled through the city streets, Klyachkivsky thought of the business that awaited him in the immediate future.\n\nThe UPA - his UPA - was not secure. Stetsko, Shukhevych, and so many others fought him for control, for influence, and for the right to determine the destiny of Ukraine. Things, he knew, were coming to a head, and he would soon need to take action. He had, of course, been planning that action for some time. A coordinated purge, whereby-\n\nAlarm raced through his mind as his driver made a sudden - and unexpected - turn into an alleyway. Demanding explanation, none was given as he saw, out of the corner of his eye, the barrel of a machine gun extending from a window high above. The gunfire that followed wiped all thoughts from his mind forever more.\n\nWhen it was over, the would-be Vozhd lay dead, riddled with bullets. Locals soon arrived, attracted by the noise. Though they were shocked by the identity of the dead man, none could explain what had happened, not to each other nor to the soldiers who rapidly descended upon the scene.\n\nOne of the most powerful men in Ukraine had been killed - and there was not a witness to be found. That spoke volumes in itself."
BOV_fraternal_coup.9.a: "An ignoble end."

BOV_fraternal_coup.10.t: "The Blunted Blow"
BOV_fraternal_coup.10.d: "The old doors of the government building creaked as Stetsko burst through them. He could only anticipate the grisly scene that would give way to his majestic vision, and yet the absence of corpses and bloodstains was an ill omen. The clomping of enraged boots announced the arrival of an inflamed Lenkavskyi, who stormed towards Stetsko.\n\n"Yaroslav!" Lenkavskyi yelled. "How convenient that a craven like you fortuitously arrives after a failed attempt on our lives!" Lenkavskyi's incensed rage echoed through the halls, catching the attention of the surviving guards.\n\n"I heard that the Vozhd had been assassinated and arrived as swiftly as I was able," Stetsko crooned. "The nation needs stability, Stepan, and a wise hand to steer it," Stetsko barbed. "Since when was it criminal to answer the nation's call in its time of need?"\n\n"We'll know who the criminals are when we finish interrogating the assailants we captured," Lenskavsky retorted as he turned away. "Only one punishment awaits traitors, Yaroslav: death. I will not rest until justice has reaped the life of every turncoat. Even if that means killing you," Lenkavskyi said before leaving Stetsko behind.\n\nStetsko was left speechless, having no counter to snipe back with. He stepped out of the building to return to his car. His soldiers didn't just make a mistake; they managed to jeopardize the entire operation. Lenkavskyi lived - he would not rest until he collected a butcher's toll as retribution."
BOV_fraternal_coup.10.a: "Ukraine is naught but a slab of meat served to Hell's hounds."

BOV_fraternal_coup.11.t: "Rebellion of the Castra"
BOV_fraternal_coup.11.d: "Contempt. No word could summarize Shukhevych's feelings towards the incompetent. Men who are too spineless, cowardly, and incapable are to learn discipline and heroism from their superiors. Such is the natural way of the world, and yet every breath Stetsko took with his asthmatic lungs defied that principle. Was it not fated by nature that Stetsko would fail because of his own spiritless timidity? The failed assault upon Klyachkivsky's lackeys had left no opportunity for Shukhevych to intervene, and so he was left to stew as Lenkavskyi ordained his guilt in the background.\n\nTo idle in anticipation of death is no better than putting a bullet through the brain, Shukhevych had surmised. The dying embers of his fireplace devoured their final meal of detritus from Rebet's letter. Shukhevych took a long gaze at a framed picture of him, his wife, and his children mounted upon the mantle. Such a thing was a luxury during the insurgency, yet the generosity of a photographer immortalized the fleeting smiles of a family that knew only strife. Everlasting war had already robbed many children of their fathers; he could not and would not allow it to claim him too.\n\nThe exodus west to their hideouts in Galicia was an earnest affair. Fifteen years of fighting for survival had long hardened Shukhevych's men; another year would only be another notch on the belt of tragic sorrows. For family, for a better future, for Ukraine, they must live."
BOV_fraternal_coup.11.a: "Even the righteous are marionettes of the selfish."

BOV_fraternal_coup.12.t: "The Cornered Wretch"
BOV_fraternal_coup.12.d: "Land sped past the window. Golden fields of grain and sunflowers sparkled in the sun. But the men in the car did not bother observing the scenery. They chattered nervously among each other, the driver focusing intently on the road and nothing more.\n\n"It was a witless maneuver. I should have known it would fail."\n\nThe aged, bespectacled man grumbled angrily to himself. No one paid attention, for it was not the first time he had said something to that effect. Yaroslav Stetsko had been, in all respects, a wreck since they had hastily departed Kyiv. He had become withdrawn from his family and friends, taken to merely his books and mumbling to himself about what had gone wrong.\n\n"It was all for naught, it was all for naught. What we should we do when we depart? The Germans will never forgive me..."\nStetsko's thoughts swirled. But for the first time since he had crawled into this stuffed cramped vehicle he had an idea. The Germans, yes, the Germans; they would hang him of course... But would they really? He was a mutineer against treason and the madman Klyachkivksy, he was a sane administrator. Zaporizhzhya may be their salvation! Legions of loyalists desperate for pardon and stability, a functioning grain market, and loyal intelligent Ukrainians? What more could they want?\n\n"Of course!" He cried suddenly, nearly sending the driver careening off the road. "Men we shall decamp into the city and end this idiocy. We shall form a new government!". Everyone in the car was still somewhat shaken by almost meeting their maker, and they played along with the suggestion. While they did not exactly expect to curl up and die when they reached their destination, the formation of civil administration was certainly not at the top list of their priorities. "Yes, yes, I shall contact them all," Stetsko continued eagerly, scribbling out his thoughts in an open book."
BOV_fraternal_coup.12.a: "The greatest gift Germany could ever request..."

BOV_fraternal_coup.13.t: "Pandemonium's Waltz"
BOV_fraternal_coup.13.d: "When Lenkavskyi survived the coup attempt, it was an inevitability that a new purge would be called, but unlike the previous purges, there was no loyal or fearful army to carry out the orders. Additionally, unlike the previous purges, Lenkavskyi targeted the most powerful leaders, calling for Stetsko and Shukhyevch to stand trial. As a result, it was unsurprising that, unlike previous purges, someone would dare to fight back.\n\nThe fires of rebellion had quickly engulfed most of Ukraine. Shukhevych had taken most of the organized army with him to the west, and Stetsko's absent bureaucrats left Lenkavskyi with a state hollow of functionality as they built a rival government in the south. The odds were against the true followers of Bandera's will, yet they would bleed for Ukraine's future all the same.\n\nThe Ukrainian Civil War did not end with Klyachkivsky's victory; it had only taken a brief pause. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army, whose rotten foundation had endured relentless punishment, had reached its limit as three ambitious men rallied their followers to a new war. Bandera can only watch from the heavens as the men he called brothers destroy everything he fought for."
BOV_fraternal_coup.13.a: "Slava Ukraini..."

BOV_fraternal_coup.14.t: "A Duel of Destiny"
BOV_fraternal_coup.14.d: "The click of Stetsko's shoes sliced through the silence of the government building. Bullet marks lined the walls in concert with fresh bloodstains throughout every noticeable hall. It was a flawless purge, an orchestration of chaos so perfect that a smirk broke through the man's steely countenance. Myron and Lenkavskyi, the two biggest obstacles to his ambitions, were naught but corpses, but Stetsko was really doing them a favor. After all, their ideas would live on through him rather than die with a paranoid Vozhd's mad crusade. It was unfathomable why smart men like them would fail to realize such a simple truth. The harsh slam of a door interrupted Stetsko's thoughts as Shukhevych entered opposite of him, flanked by his bodyguards.\n\nThe grim general and the bold bureaucrat immediately made eye contact as their poker faces held firm. The eerie quiet was broken by the occasional crackle of gunfire in the distance, which grew closer by the second. Stetsko's thoughts raced through his head. This wasn't part of the plan. Roman shouldn't be here. Shukhevych's piercing glare made Stetsko feel exposed, and that was the moment everything made sense. Shukhevych knew everything!\n\nStetsko weighed his options. Even if Shukhevych approved of the plan, the stubborn mule would likely remain unconvinced no matter how correct his ideas were. The twitch of a corpse nearby caught Stetsko's eye. The solution to his problem was obvious. The missing piece of the puzzle was right in front of him: the scapegoat."
BOV_fraternal_coup.14.a: "Fates clash as brothers die."

BOV_fraternal_coup.15.d: "Stetsko bolted towards a hallway as Shukhevych's bodyguards rushed towards him. The general himself only trotted along, like a patient hunter confident in the ensnarement of his prey. His men had already begun apprehending Stetsko's killers; there was nowhere for the weasel to flee. A traitor was going to die, and for the first time in a long while, Shukhevych was going to be happy about it.\n\nStetsko did not make it far before a guard lunged and tackled him to the floor. A few of his hitmen ran to his aid, only to be shot by the rest of Shukhevych's guards upon entry. Stetsko was dragged across the floor, wheezing from the burst of physical exertion. The battered ideologue looked up at Shukhevych with a bloody nose and cracked glasses.\n\n"What is the meaning of this Roman?" Stetsko gasped.\n\n"I should be asking you that question. You've betrayed everyth-"\n\n"Don't act as if you didn't intend to dispose of Dmytro too!" Stetsko sneered. "Moralizing isn't your strong suit, Roman; we've always done what was best for Ukraine." Stetsko's agitation subsided. "Our interests are clearly aligned, Roman, so why don't we work together?" Shukhevych paused, feigning contemplation.\n\n"The punishment for treason is death," Shukhevych coldly uttered before he unholstered his pistol and fired it straight into Stetsko's skull. The weak man's body fell limp as his brain matter spilled onto the tile. Shukhevych did not spare him a second glance as he left the room. There was work to be done."

BOV_fraternal_coup.16.t: "Writs of Execution"
BOV_fraternal_coup.16.d: "Shukhevych thought it ironic that his first actions as Vozhd would be executing his foes, yet disposing of the nation's enemies was the duty of every patriot, even if they were also Ukrainian. It was a well-kept secret that Stetsko's wife, Slava, was publishing dissent under the guise of pseudonyms, but with the mask shattered, she would have to reflect on her actions for the rest of her life in prison. Shukhevych was no stranger to mercy after all, and while Slava's silver tongue undermined his cause, she was performing her role as a dutiful wife and would get leniency for it.\n\nShukhevych could not extend that mercy to the fools that went along with Stetsko's plot. While the generals were innocent of direct involvement, their shortsighted loyalties made them a significant liability. Retiring them with medals would keep them far away from power while keeping their honor intact.\n\nAs for Stetsko's closest allies, Piasetsky, Lebed, and Rebet, they would all have to perish. Piasetsky was a tool who let his discontent become arrogant ambition, incapable of providing for a cause that demands sacrifice. Lebed, the great orchestrator of purges, had disappeared, and many would take solace in his death were he to be found. Rebet gave the old general pause; he was the lynchpin in revealing Stetsko's treachery, but he was also a key plotter too. Rebet was a good man with good intentions, but a traitor was a traitor all the same. Rebet had to die with the rest.\n\nShukhevych signed the warrants with a hesitant pen. When Klyachkivsky had purged Fedun, they had lost far more than they had gained. He could only hope that this purge would be the last, lest he become what he despised."

BOV_fraternal_coup.17.t: "Inconveniences Erased"
BOV_fraternal_coup.17.d: "Rebet's letter was erased by fire in a mere instant, yet Shukhevych's own doubts lingered. For decades, he had served Ukraine with excellency, but despite this, he felt dissatisfaction. Stetsko's biting accusation would've been true had the weasel not acted first. If he hadn't felt guilty about such a fact, the only evidence of his potential collusion wouldn't be cinders and ash. It would be pointless deceit to assert he had no ambition of his own, for he was now Vozhd, a title that required a strong man to wield effectively. What would Konovalets do?\n\nThe question stuck with Shukhevych. He first met the original Vozhd as a teenager while he rented a room from their family's hotel. Konovalets' tales of war and struggle for Ukrainian freedom inspired him to rise to the occasion, and he had won Ukraine's freedom, but at what cost? He had fought his Ukrainian brethren just as much as he fought the German oppressor. Had Bandera even been right in splitting so violently from Melnyk? Could all the bloodshed have been avoided? They clearly strayed from Konovalet's will. His mentor didn't pull the trigger for a reason, and they foolishly allowed Melnyk's corruption to fester because of their own shortsighted fanaticism. Were they all fools for not realizing something so obvious?\n\nShukhevych was now Vozhd, with a weaker and more disunified Ukraine than during the time of Konovalets. It would not be enough to replicate the actions of his wise mentor; he would have to be better, stronger, and smarter. Ukraine must be more than petty political squabbles, for it will not survive if its powerful spirit is not whole. Ukraine's glory shall be eternal; the Vozhd must make it so."

BOV_fraternal_coup.18.d: "The radio address was unscheduled, sudden, and surely to be critical. The engineers at the radio station understood this implicitly, on account of the soldiers watching them very closely. With safeties off.\n\nIn the booth, Yaroslav Stetsko withdrew the prepared speech from his jacket pocket, adjusted his position, and began to speak. A momentary delay was encountered when the sounds of the soldiers, encountering other radio engineers less favorable to oversight and opening fire immediately, overwhelmed the microphone. But as the gunfire died down, Stetsko's voice increased in intensity.\n\nHis message was simple, yet unmistakable. Shukhevych, and those loyal to him, had betrayed Ukraine: they had collaborated with invaders, subversives, and degenerates all, with the end goal being the dismemberment of the state for personal enrichment. He provided a long list of 'evidence' to support this, trusting that quantity would overwhelm quantity, and promised harsh punishment.\n\nJustice would be dispensed, Stetsko proclaimed, in good time. Shukhevych would not escape, nor would anyone affiliated with him, assisting him, or enabling him in any fashion. And once they were punished for their actions? Well, then, Ukraine would be truly protected from subversion.\n\nAnother gunshot rang out from somewhere in the station. Stetsko ended the address."

At least his executioners recognized the importance of the man they were about to shoot.\n\nOr, rather, man. Shukhevych was not afraid to die. He had faced death many times before, from many different people, organizations, and countries, in his quest to bring his vision of Ukraine about, and he was ready to embrace it. But as he was tied to the post, looking across to where the firing squad would stand, he could see his son being led across the square, blindfolded as he had been, and his heart sank.\n\nThey had tried to escape together, doing so himself only to make sure that his son would live, but had failed. Those who had stolen the country had been just as efficient as Shukhevych knew he himself would have been in tracking down their enemies, and once captured they had quickly been bundled here.\n\nAs his son was similarly tied to the post they exchanged their final words. Shukhevych told his son how proud he was of him, and apologized for his failure. His son said the same, and the bravery with which he was facing the same fate inspired intense pride in those last moments.\n\nThe order was shouted. The end came. The bodies would remain there for some time."

At the map of the country that he was on the cusp of bringing to greatness.\n\nSlava had been his confidant and verbal sparring partner for many years, and they had shared many conversations about how to return Ukraine to the greatness it had once held. About what they would do once he had secured the necessary power. Which was now the case.\n\nThey shared their coffee as they went through the first ones to implement. Social? Economic? Military? There were positives and negatives to each one, and they went through them one by one, until finally settling on the one that would be most beneficial, politically, while also advancing the national goals in some small fashion. It was perfect.\n\nA sudden tremble ran through Stetsko's hands, causing him to drop his cup on the map, staining it deep brown. Slava quickly rolled it up, throwing it in the trash. It was unimportant, they both concluded. They could get another one."

BOV_Klyachkivsky_buildup.1.d: ""That thing slithered in my presence, I introduced that thing to my wife and children, I trusted that thing!"\n\nDmytro Klyachkivksy bellowed. Glass littered the floor of the General's sumptuous Kiew residence. Tapestries lay in tatters on the floor, the rest had been carefully and secretly removed by the staff. Klyachkivsky's rage had reached a point where it had no end. It was like a stormy sea, it never ceased its waves, they merely changed length and width.\n\n"Stetsko was manipulated. He had to have been. Kind Stetsko, good Stetsko, loyal Stetsko..." Klyachkivsky babbled. "I always knew Shukhevych was good for nothing. He was a wasteful idiot with Bandera and a stupid liberal to beat! He was probably in bed with the Yankees the whole time...Yes! The Americans, the Jews all of them...Russians..."\n\nKlyachkivsky's servants eyed each other nervously from behind walls or in hidden covens. Klyachkivsky had developed a delightful new habit of appearing at random points to scream at and berate lone servants. "Where is Stetsko's bitch wife? That cur, that manipulating cur she was always in bed, oh literally, definitely, literally in bed with Shukhevych..." Klyachkivsky wandered to the bathroom, before storming out again with a crash.\n\n"Gentlemen summon a car, I wish to appraise what's left of my government!"\n\nThe entire staff of servants rushed to the street, panicking while beseeching the driver to begin preparations."

BOV_Klyachkivsky_buildup.2.t: "Normalcy crumbling"
BOV_Klyachkivsky_buildup.2.d: " Neat lines were what Klyachkivsky liked. Years of thick and uncut forest and disordered camps had taught him the virtue of that. The men comprising the police of Kyiv were idiots. Shukhevych appointees the lot of them, they had been sent southwards, some further than the land itself. These new policemen were different, they may have been on the opposite side of the bars in certain cases, but they were loyal, at least, that's what the recruiter said.\n\nHe had lied, everyone lied to Klyachkivsky, and he knew it.\n\nThe hall was cold, and the heating system had died, few knew how to fix old Soviet contraptions, and even those who did were unlikely to even come close to the buildings of the volatile government. No windows let in any of the tepid warmth of sunlight, let alone its glow. All that illuminated the police conscript was a single flickering lantern just above their heads.\n\nFootsteps, many of them. The recruits, the smart ones at least, tensed up. This was their moment.\n\nKlyachkivsky was far less imposing in person than the myriad propaganda posters of the regime made him out to be. He was a sad figure in person, his skin drawn taught over his features, his brow bore a now permanent furrow, and his moth seemed sucked into a forever scowl. He silently appraised each and every new policeman, stopping before none, yet making each feel as though he had stared into their very souls. Finally, he stopped, briskly walking back to the entrance, guards following closely behind. The door slammed, and most of the men flinched."

BOV_Klyachkivsky_buildup.3.d: "As the man in front of the group cowered in fear on his knees, all the others - bureaucrats newly and rapidly hired to fill the state ranks - knew that there was going to be a great price to be paid indeed.\n\nFor the Vozhd was here. And he was very unhappy.\n\nThe reports had not been correct. The numbers had not added up. And the man on his knees was the cause of it all. He had been embezzling funds, stealing from the scant revenues that had been tortuously collected and which were vital for the operation of the state as a whole, and the Vozhd had clearly decided that it was an issue he would personally attend to.\n\nThey all listened to the man who they had worked beside beg for his life, pleading at how there had been no choice, that his children were starving, and that he had to find funds for them. They all knew he spoke the truth, many of them being in a similar situation and hoping that their own thefts had not been similarly discovered.\n\nThe Vozhd listened carefully. At the end of it all those watching saw him make a single nod as he pulled the man to his feet. He would be merciful. He understood their plight. And so the man would not be executed. But he would pay for his theft, at a ratio of four-to-one. In fingers. The man's relief turned to terror as the bodyguards rushed forward. As the hammer came out. As the sound of crunching bone echoed through the office.\n\nAt the end, the man whimpered as his co-workers did their best to ignore him, thankful that they had not been in his position. He would continue to do so for many days to come."

BOV_Klyachkivsky_buildup.4.d: "Klyachivsky could feel his rage building as he looked at the reports neatly stacked upon his desk. Each and every one detailed the attacks of another enemy of the state, of the people, of him. Attacks aimed at the nascent state he had managed to carve out.\n\nHe would not have it.\n\nHe had not worked, fought, and suffered for years at the hands of the Germans and their despised collaborators, not triumphed over them to such a degree, to suffer the slings and arrows of such filth. Melnykites. Judeo-Bolsheviks. Bandits. All of them scum. All of them enemies. All of them refusing to follow his lead, his vision.\n\nAnd they multiplied. Every day there seemed to be more of them, and the reports of their activities only grew longer. They rampaged across the countryside, striking garrisons, villages, patrols, and anything else that they could find. They attacked his soldiers, the citizenry, and even each other. Slavering beasts, all. But he had encountered such beasts before, and had bested them. Had killed them. To a one.\n\nSoon that would be the fate of all those mentioned in the reports as well. He knew it would be so. He promised himself that it would be so. He trusted in the inevitability of his victory.\n\nAfter all, he had been right about it thus far."

The other children rushed to collect it, both for enjoyment and because any food of was immense value, but the girl stayed away.\n\nShe remembered her father's anger the last time the soldier had come. The last time she had taken the offered candy. What he had told her about their family and the UPA, and though she couldn't describe it in complex fashion and wouldn't have known the word, she knew there was an ulterior motive to his actions. So she stayed away, and avoided him.\n\nHer friends did not. They did not understand as she now did, and would not listen when she told them to avoid him as well. They called her scared. They stopped talking to her. They told others to do the same. It hurt terribly, but every time she was tempted to give in, she thought of her father's face the last time he had spoken about it.\n\nSo she endured. When she returned home in tears, she found her father waiting. He was proud of her, he said, and the other children would soon learn their mistake. And then he hugged her.

If only his mother could see that hat, how many hours of sweat and tears and even a few drops of blood went into procuring it. Even a few years ago, that hat would have been impossible, the Poles wouldn't make them, even though they knew how. No, the dark factory sucked them up and spat them out pale and tired. Few pale and tired men made hats such as these. Only after the German barbarians were shown the door could the Poles return to their purpose and glorious profession of hattery.\n\nVolodymyr whistled a happy tune, what counted for the business district of the village had seen new life, not just for hatters, but butchers; who hawked new and exotic meats (by god they had beef!), Farmers; now sold more than just moldy carrots and stale bread, even a doctor offered his services!\n\nFurther along the menagerie came the Poles. For many centuries they had grown used to running the town, they bragged about how most statues in the public squares were Poles, how the churches, even the Orthodox, they alleged, were built by Poles, some confidently stated that Hitler himself was secretly a Pole. Yet, that very man had cut them down to size, even his departure had left them in a bind. The Polish wealthy had fled as Ukrainian boots tramped through the village, the Polish poor hid and the Polish middle attempted to live as normal. They quickly joined the poor at the thunder of leaflets and posters.\n\nVolodymyr looked at these sorry men, these animals who hawked junk and fungi. He humored them and paid a valued coin for a piece of burlap. He could not help but have his hand migrate to his ever-precious headgear to defend it from the sticky hands of these desperate people. Finally, Volodymyr stopped.\n\n"A mark for that! You rascal, you...you...Jew!"\n\nVolodymyr scarcely let out the words before regretting it. The Poles stared at him, angrily, impotently, sadly.

Klyachkivsky continued his writing, before suddenly snatching the documents away. His face was obscured by the rather large folder, yet the anger was obvious as he nearly ripped the corner off of every page he turned. Finally, he set the folder down gently.\n\n"Get me the generals, tell them it's about the situation in Galicia. I want you to take minutes."\n\nFew men openly disobeyed the Vozhd, and his generals weren't among them. Klyachkivsky sat silently at his desk in front of his top brass, emotionless, his pale eyes staring at each one. "This..." he said softly, pushing the folder to the middle of the desk. "...is unacceptable." The generals stole glances at one another, but not one spoke.\n\n"Galicia is the embryo of our movement. It is the hotbed of Ukrainian National thought and it is the seedbed for our dear departed Stepan Bandera." Every man was silent for a moment to honor that dead demigod. "Yet now, it is a battleground, one which we seem to be losing." Klyachkivsky's tone broke into a growl for a moment. "I want every Pole in that land buried in it or out of it. We all do, yet it seems you have been soft-hearted. Kill the bombers' families, burn their farms, kill any who shelter them, and liquidate on sight. How hard is that!" Kliachesky slammed his fist on the desk, making the generals flinch.\n\n"Sir, we can't expect the Poles not to do likewise, any more of that and they'll start targeting the civilians..." One general stuttered. He quickly realized his mistake.\n\n"Perhaps they should! Perhaps it is time the Ukranian people learn the nature of racial conflict and learn a Ukranian state can not exist unless it is populated only by Ukranians! No half measures, break open the caches! Give farmboys rifles and tell them to shoot Poles like fowl if you have to!" Klyachkivsky ranted and raved. The generals emerged, with one solution duly hammered into each of their heads."

"Perhaps you might just be spared if you do so quickly."\n\nDesperation took hold, and the captive Melnykite began to shout out the names and locations of his fellow OUN-M members. He hoped against hope that his cooperation would be enough to save him.\n\nThe interrogator laughed, a cold, heartless sound that reverberated throughout the room. "You Melnykites have grown weak. It's no wonder, given how you let Germany trample us for two decades without resistance. Now, it's our turn to trample you. A true Ukrainian would never betray his comrades; he'd die a thousand times over for his country! You, traitors, squandered your chance at redemption a long ago, and we won't be as forgiving as the Germans."\n\nThe prisoner's heart sank as the interrogator's laughter filled the room, echoing in his ears.

Because of him, the humiliation of Galicia would be avenged. Because of him, Bandera's vision would be fulfilled.\n\n"Soldiers, friends," he began, his demeanor calm, his voice stern.

Galicia is Ukrainian, one and indivisible."\n\nThere was a loud roar of approval from the soldiers. It was the call of men whose blood was hot, raging, and screaming for battle. Klyachkivsky made a gesture, and the noise instantly died. "Galicia is more than our land. It is where the birthplace of our movement began, and the home of Bandera himself."\n\nHe indicated behind him, in the general direction of Galicia.

And an important resource consideration besides.\n\nStepping out of his command car, he conferred with the other officers as he looked over at the town square, where hundreds of Polish civilians, the town inhabitants, stood. Quiet and huddled together, he noticed how few young men there were among them. That was good, he thought, for what was to come.\n\nThere was no provision, he explained to the officers, for saboteurs in the rear. The Vozhd had made the perfidy of the Poles very clear and they could not leave them to cause mischief, as their men clearly already had that morning. At the same time, however, supplies were scarce. The morning clash had used far more ammunition than expected, and what remained needed to be conserved for the next fight.\n\nHe departed soon after, instructing them to form up their units after they were done.

The scenes were nearly identical to those two decades earlier however, this time, there was even less to lose.\n\nAmidst the turmoil, a young Polish woman named Marta huddled in the corner of her family's home, tightly clutching her younger brother, Piotr, to her chest. The sounds of gunfire and screams filled the air, and Marta prayed they would be spared from the violence outside their door.\n\nThe soldiers, driven by Klyachkivsky's vision, were relentless in their pursuit of death. They moved from house to house, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. The terror that had gripped the city was no accident but rather a calculated act of aggression designed to instill fear and submission, a warning of things of even worse things to come.\n\nWith the cloak of night, Marta and Piotr ventured out of their hiding place as they heard both flame and soldiers come ever closer. Desperate to find safety, The siblings navigated through the devastated streets, the sights and sounds of the brutal invasion haunting them at every turn. They knew that the home they had once known was gone, their few years of freedom being taken once again.They gazed from the hillside that overlooked their former home. Years of memories disappeared in an hour. They had little time to stare as the Ukrainian advance continued."

The small family hiding in their home knew that what was coming was inevitable, and that they didn't have much time left.\n\nRuslana was sickened with worry, thinking desperately of something, anything she could do. "You need to hide," her husband said quietly, sitting near the window. "Take the kids to the cellar and stay there. If you're with me when they come, they'll kill you too."\n\nShe knew they would. These Banderites were monsters, with a particular hatred of Poles. While Ruslana was Ukrainian, and might have lived through their brutality, her husband was a Pole. In the eyes of the Banderites, it was an unholy union, and they would almost certainly kill her along with him.\n\n"I'll take them down," she finally said, pulling herself together. "And then-"\n\n"And then you will hide," he insisted, shooting a glance at the door. "Go! Hurry!"\n\nShe quickly grabbed her children and took them to the cellar. Both of them were scared, crying and just waiting for it to be over. It was only a few minutes of making sure they were situated before she realized she couldn't do it. She couldn't wait here for him to die. "Stay here," she told them, forcing a comforting smile. "I'll be right back."\n\nThe children only nodded, as she quickly returned up the stairs. Both children then heard muffled sounds above. Sounds of struggle, a gunshot, and a scream. Everything went silent, and as both children hid in the basement, the realization settled in.

The parade was magnificent, and Klyachkivsky had a small, but genuine smile as he looked out into the crowds.\n\nThis was a triumph only comparable to when they had first reclaimed Ukraine itself. Galicia was home, where she rightfully belonged.\n\nThe Poles had tried to fight, of course. They had attempted to stem the tide of Ukrainians pouring into Galicia, but they had wilted under the force that had been brought to bear. They could not stand against the sons of Ukraine, for they knew what they were fighting for was not their own.\n\nMeter by bloody meter, Galicia had been reclaimed, and the Poles who had once dominated it had fled or been dealt with.\n\nAs Galicia became soaked in the blood of Poles, they had finally conceded defeat once Ukraine had begun encroaching on Poland itself. Tempting as it might have been to end the Polish menace once and for all, Klyachkivsky was satisfied with Galicia. The Poles had been humiliated, broken, and would never trouble Ukraine again.\n\nHis legacy was now secured as the man who had first liberated Ukraine, and now had brought them victory in Galicia. Soon, he would be known as the man who would make Ukraine whole once more. The men who surrounded him were all smiles as he prepared to give his victory speech, and just for a moment Klyachkivsky basked in the adoration and euphoria as the crowds shouted his name.\n\nThis, he knew, was only the beginning."

He and his commanders stood around the table they had planned military operations before, and this time, the plans detailed an invasion of Hungary to reclaim the rightful Ukrainian lands they held. His commanders had been with him through it all; they were reliable when others had abandoned or betrayed him. There were few that he felt he could rely on - which made him surprised, disappointed, and concerned when they began raising their voices in dissent.\n\n"Vozhd, we've achieved victories that were said to be impossible," one of them said hesitantly, clearly nervous about speaking. "But we need to take care of our people now. The fighting left significant damage we need to rebuild. Once we do-"\n\nA single raised hand silenced the insubordinate officer. Klyachkivsky turned his cold eyes towards the wilting man. He let the silence hang ominously before he answered.\n\n"If we do it now, then there will not be another opportunity," Klyachkivsky reprimanded. "Anyone in possession of Ukrainian lands knows we will come to reclaim them. They will prepare, and more Ukrainian blood will be spent. We either strike now, or condemn more of Ukraine's sons to die later."\n\nThat authoritative statement was enough to silence any remaining dissent, if not completely. He would need to investigate this later. This kind of open defiance could prove troublesome once the wars were over. The conversation turned to more practical matters; troop positions, Hungarian defenses, and allocated resources.\n\nSo engrossed in the conversation, that none of them paid attention to the guards in the room. Not until the conversation abruptly stopped as they became aware of a gun that had been raised, aimed straight at the Vozhd's head."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.1.d: "Roman Shukhevych slipped a new ink cartridge into his pen. Moonlight trickled through the curtains. He was cold and tired. Wraithlike, wrapped in a short blue quilt, he leaned across the desk and dragged the lamp closer until his face was hot. Roman kicked off his shoes and stretched his legs and stood for the first time today. He glared for a few moments at the notes on his desk. He could not read his writing. It was late—a stained-glass window was wrapped around his eyes.\n\nHe could still remember what he wrote down. His plan was clear in his head: build from the certain.\n\nBuild from the certain because it is basic. Think ant. Destroy Melnykites and reward cooperative partisans. Disrupt and be punished, cooperate and be rewarded. Ukraine could only reclaim Galicia after that's sunk in. "It adds up," Roman mumbled, "to a sense of unity. Haven't had that in a while."\n\nRoman turned as his door opened. Nataliya crept in quietly. "Roman," she whispered, "I don't tell you not to do silly things. You often know they're silly. So why are you still up?"\n\n"It's for tomorrow. The days after. I'm getting it all done now."\n\nShe smiled. "Ok." She strode across the floor and pinched his ear and did not let go.

As anonymous creatures were scurrying in the rafters of the palace, Shukhevych and Pozychanyuk shunted the door bolts locked and took peace in a quiet heated antechamber. The air duct hummed.\n\nRoman clasped his forehead, kneading his skin like a pound of dough. His skull felt soft. "About the Republicans, the Communists," he said, "I won't confuse our message. Not going to confuse that. And I don't want to negotiate." He stretched his hands over the air duct and let it breathe warm breaths over his hands. "Why should we compromise with defeated parties? We shouldn't. I don't see it."\n\nRoman's expression was static, his features still as pinned insects on paperboard. "What we should do is promote constancy. So we warn them. The Republicans and the Communists. If they don't surrender, we have a mandate to clamp down. If they do, there's no problem. If we start negotiations now, and they fail, it'll look like our fault."\n\n"Everything looks like our fault," Yosyp said. "We say we're a strong government, so who is left to blame besides us? If a village is robbed, that's our failure. 'Why can't my government protect me?' That's what people will ask."\n\nYosyp crossed his arms and hugged his pill white coat closer to his skin. "If we negotiate, we'd have the opportunity to give the Republicans and the Communists a reason to keep their weapons down for the foreseeable future. Make something binding, set the terms for this new contract of state we're writing.""

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.3.t: "An Unexpected Truce"
BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.3.d: "In a dimly lit, underground hideout, a small group of Communist insurgents huddled around a table, planning their next move against the new regime. They were one of the last cells of the dwindling communists and were clueless as to how to proceed. As their discussion continued, a worn envelope, mysteriously placed on the table, caught their attention. Cautiously, the leader of the cell, Maxim, picked it up and examined it. The group gathered around as Maxim opened the letter, their curiosity piqued.\n\nThe letter was from none other than Shukhevych himself, the so-called Vozhd of Ukraine. To their astonishment, he offered them a guarantee of safety in exchange for ceasing their activities against his government. The proposal was baffling, and the insurgents thoroughly questioned the motives behind such a seemingly forgiving offer. They wondered why, despite being fully capable of destroying them, the government had offered forgiveness?\n\nAfter a lengthy debate, the group decided they had little to lose by accepting Shukhevych's offer. They had been losing faith in their cause for some time. The nationalists had well and truly subjugated most of their opposition. The prospect of another communist revolution seemed impossible, with nearly all of the movement's leaders dead, and now they were cornered. Maxim penned their response, agreeing to cease their activities, and returned the letter.\n\nFor days after, they waited anxiously for any response or any reprisal, and there was none. As their anxiety faded away and the group acclimated back into society, the Vozhd's motivations became clearer. If Ukraine is to resist what is coming, decades-old grudges need to be forgiven. There is no need for squabbles over ideology as Ukraine stares down the German behemoth."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.4.d: "In a small, hidden safe house on the outskirts of Kyiv, a group of Republican insurgents huddled together, their faces illuminated by the flickering candlelight as they discussed their current predicament. Their discussions were interrupted when a crackling voice came through the radio, a broadcast from Shukhevych himself directed at all the insurgents within Ukraine. The tension in the room was palpable as they listened to the ultimatum.\n\n"To all Ukrainians who have been led astray, we offer you a chance at salvation. Your leaders have been crushed, and you are nothing but a thorn in the nation's side. Still, Ukrainians do not need to shed any more Ukrainian blood. Foreign powers seek to subjugate us. There is a much more worthy fight on the horizon. Cease all hostilities immediately. Those who give up their arms will be forgiven. But those enemies of the nation who continue will be wholly annihilated!"\n\nLong hours of heated debate ensued as the insurgents grappled with the decision that would determine their future. Many ultimately did choose to give in. To them, a free Ukraine seemed further away than it had ever been. The Nationalists had captured the minds of the Ukrainian people with their defeat of the Germans, and the hope of a soon to be democratic Ukraine had been extinguished for many."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.5.t: "Farm Wars"
BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.5.d: "Shukevych sat silently and watched the war being waged before him. It was the Melnykite nationalist who had brought the issue to Shukevych's attention, angrily storming into his office with a letter and a righteous fury. It seemed so mundane, so irrelevant, a mere land dispute.\n\nA year ago, a Ukrainian farmer on the Galician border had sold two acres of his farm to his neighbor, a man of quarter-Polish descent. The farmer has now petitioned the government, demanding full restitution of the land, based on his purer Ukrainian heritage. Naturally, the Melnykite had seen this land dispute as the next great Ukrainian racial struggle and sided with the farmer.\n\nNot wanting to concern himself with such trivial matters, Shukeyvch had called in one of the few civil servants left in the region to resolve the issue. This was the first mistake. The bureaucrat was a Republican, and worse, a bleeding heart moralist. He made the point that the Ukrainian farmer already had vast tracts of land and moreover had been paid his legal tender. The Melnykite responded by calling the Republican a Jew.\n\nAn hour later, it seemed as if they weren't even discussing the issue anymore, simply banging their fists on the table like Neanderthals. Shukeych knew if this lasted a second more, either someone would get shot or he would fall over from an aneurysm. "Enough!" he shouted. Standing up and taking out a lighter, speaking with an exasperated sigh. "I will be taking a cigarette break, if you two have not come to a decision by the time I get back, I'll bring in one of the communists to make it for you."\n\nA few minutes later, leaning against a wooden pillar, Shukevych's mind began to drift with the cloud of cheap tobacco.

Many of them admittedly made Larysa very jealous, as all of it looked so very appetizing, and none of her classmates or friends would share. He promised he would give it to any child that just brought him books that he'd said were written by 'Very bad people.'\n\nShe'd heard a bit about what he was explicitly asking for, and she honestly didn't recognize any of the names, or why they were bad. But because of what her father had said, she was doubtful that they were as bad as he was claiming. She resolved that he was probably lying, and was dishonest, like her father had said.\n\nStill, all of this had made her curious about what these supposedly dangerous books were. Were regular words actually dangerous or scary? If the Candyman was scared of them, then maybe it would be good for her to learn for herself. Her father had told her to stay away and not put herself in danger, but right now, he wasn't here.\n\nCuriosity overrode parental authority, especially when she saw an opportunity right in front of her, with the Candyman distracted. She'd watched the Candyman from a distance, and saw that he had one stack of books resting on a bench, while he was off trying to entice the children at the playground. She quickly moved forward, grabbed the top one off the stack, and quickly ran away.\n\nHeart racing from her thrilling escapade, she looked at the book she'd picked up, and it didn't strike her as impressive. She glanced over the title - 'Ukrainian Nationalism in...' it was a really long title, and written by someone called Dontsov. Well, maybe it would be interesting and she'd take a look later.\n\nShe'd just make sure not to tell father where she'd found it."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.8.d: "Shukhevych did not enjoy these kinds of decisions.\n\nLeadership was difficult. Commanding a nation even more so. It had been simpler when their organization had been limited. A militant force with a specific, ideal focus was easier to manage and oversee. It was never easy to be a leader, but the difficult decisions had less of a chance to tear open wounds, or create societal fissures.\n\nShukhevych sat at his desk as the day faded away, contemplating the situation before him, and the choices that had to be made. There were those who pushed him to incorporate the Melnykites into the government, as they would be useful in administering the state, and improve the stability of the nation.\n\nThey were also traitors.\n\nIt was that fact that made the decision a difficult one. Before, it would have been a simple decision, and the traitors would have been made examples of. Things were no longer as simple. The UPA was no longer the central focus in his decision making. Now, Ukraine came first, which turned the choice from black and white to a dark gray.\n\nHe looked at the picture of Konovalets on his shelf, as if it would give him the solutions he lacked right now. He wondered what Konovalets would do in this situation? Would he do what was necessary to improve the stability of the nation? Or remove treason wherever it was found? He was also acutely aware that many would take the pardoning of traitors poorly, which might negate any stability that came from sparing them.\n\nOne thing was certain - some people needed to die. There was no shortage of those who were deserving. The only question was which of them to hang."

Though many of them had acted out of pragmatism, driven by a desire for survival amidst the hopelessness of German occupation, their actions left a stain on their reputations that could never be washed away.\n\nWhile the sentences handed down by Shukhevych's government were often lenient, especially compared to the harsher treatment they might have faced under Klyachkivsky's government, the public branding of these individuals as collaborators was the ultimate mark of shame. The names of the guilty were printed in bold letters, ensuring that their past sins would follow them for the rest of their lives. Still, they were needed. Too many Ukrainians collaborated for them to all be put to death or sent to labour camps as Klyachkivsky would. The new bureaucracy needed the experience and expertise that those working in the Reichskomissariat's Administration possessed, for a time at least.\n\nDespite the more moderate approach of Shukhevych's government and their brief collaboration with the Nazis when faced with the Soviet threat, few were willing to sympathize with the collaborators. The people of Ukraine had suffered immensely under Nazi occupation, and the memories of the atrocities committed during that time were still fresh in their minds. The collaborators had chosen to side with the oppressor against the Ukrainian people..."

The crush of the crowd made it difficult for some to see the erected gallows, but Onatsky was satisfied with his view. No one here would recognize him, or how close he might have been to hanging alongside them.\n\nRegardless, this day had been a long time coming.\n\nHe knew the moment when the three men had arrived, as the sounds of jeering and mockery grew louder as the soldiers cleared a path through the crowd, pushing the doomed men forward. Each of them looked gaunt, miserable, and had clearly experienced the joys of their brief prison stint.\n\nOnatsky smiled as they were led up to the gallows, and watched the nooses be tied around their necks. None of them attempted to fight back. Sushko was breathing so heavily that Onatsky wondered if he would burst into tears. Sushko had always been a pathetic man when stripped of the strongman persona he hid behind.\n\nTheir crimes were read out, along with their sentence: Death by hanging, which received a demanding cheer from the crowd. One by one, the bodies fell and the noose stretched taut. Each of the bodies flailed for a few seconds, before going limp, leaving the necks contorted at wrong angles.\n\nAs each man died, the crowd cheered their approval, and Onatsky's eyes betrayed obvious pleasure, and his heart burned with vindication as his hated colleagues met the end they so deserved."

To Onatsky, Shukhevych had been something of an enigma. Utterly committed to the cause, but in a way that was clearly his own.\n\nHe was difficult to read; inscrutable in a way that made him worse than someone like Sushko, whose motivations were clear. Shukhevych did not have to persuade others of his authority like Sushko had; he naturally commanded attention.\n\nThey had spent most of the meeting discussing how they would be able to support Shukhevych's government - being very emphatic about their loyalty and approval with the direction of his state. Both men knew that the only reason they hadn't been strung up was because Shukhevych believed they and the rest of the Melnykites were useful.\n\nIf he sensed that they were in any way a hindrance, or worse, disloyal, Onatsky fully believed this would change.\n\nPrivately, both men held some reservations about Shukhevych's coalition. The man himself was in alignment with them on most issues, though the people around him were...less than ideal. Pozychanyuk in particular was a closet liberal, and yet Shukhevych appeared to consider him a close ally, if not friend.\n\nDespite that disconnect, this was the best any of them were going to get, and Onatsky much preferred to remain in the land of the living, serving Ukraine as best he could, then being led to the gallows because he disagreed with the most powerful man in Ukraine. No, this was the best for all involved.\n\nHe only hoped that Shukhevych agreed. Finally, once they were finished, the man didn't not speak for a few seconds, before giving a single nod."

Both of them debated a few details, though Kuk seemed satisfied with the plan. In contrast, Pozychanyuk had mostly been quiet, a concerned expression on his face. Finally he spoke. "Is this really the best approach? To attack without warning or hesitation?"\n\nKuk frowned, though Shukhevych merely faced him. "Do you disagree?"\n\n"I disagree with taking us into another war without attempting negotiation," Pozychanyuk explained. "The Poles are not fools - they know they would lose a war against us, so might they give up Galicia willingly? Is that not better than guaranteeing a war?"\n\n"And what if they use that time to entrench themselves?" Kuk questioned. "That will only make the war bloodier."\n\nPozychanyuk didn't answer right away, but he didn't look away from Shukhevych. "Then so be it. I would rather we make the attempt then begin a war for the sake of it."\n\nBoth men awaited his decision, and their leader was, as usual, difficult to read.

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.15.d: "Nataliya had not been herself after the dinner where Yuriy had shared his intentions to volunteer along the front, and Shukhevych had given his approval. He understood her fear, and he remembered she had reacted the same when he had first started fighting. Now to have their son go through the same things he had...\n\nHe did understand. He knew better than her what their son would face, what he would see, and what could happen.\n\nHe understood all too well.\n\n"Why didn't you tell him no?" She asked when they were alone, and both children were asleep.\n\nShukhevych thought about how best to answer. "It was going to come one day. It's a tradition for the men of our family to serve in the army. It's time he received some field experience."\n\n"I don't care about any of that!" She exclaimed, before falling silent, sinking onto the bed. He sat beside her, gently pulling her into a hug. "I just don't want our son to die," she whispered, tears falling from her eyes. "It's hard enough worrying about you, I need to worry about him too."\n\nHe held her tightly. "I know where he will be stationed, and the officers he is under. He will be on the front, but I will make sure it's away from the heavy fighting. I will protect him as best I can, Nataliya, but he must make his own decisions."\n\nShe exhaled. "Thank you. I don't like it, but if this is his choice...all I can do is pray for him, as well as you.""
BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.15.a: ""Then let's say a prayer, for our son.""

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.16.t: "Living Under a Shadow"
BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.16.d: "Yuriy had not taken the rebuke well.\n\nHe'd stood without another word and left the table. Shukhevych knew that the boy wasn't happy by what he'd said, but he wasn't in the habit of lying to his family, even if the truth might sting. One day Yuriy would be prepared, but not yet. He wasn't ready for the fighting that might come, especially against the Poles.\n\nNataliya had gone after him, leaving Shukhevych and Mariya at the table with food that was turning cold. Shukhevych found that his appetite was gone, and Mariya picked at her food, her own appetite seeming to have gone as well.\n\n"He's afraid, you know?" She finally said.\n\nHe looked at her inquisitively. "Your brother?"\n\n"Yeah," she answered. "Not of the fighting. That he's good enough for you. That he's not living up to you. He wants you to be proud of him, and I guess he wanted to prove it."\n\nShukhevych's normally impassive expression softened, and he closed his eyes. "I am proud of him. He doesn't need to show bravado like this to..." he trailed off.\n\n"I know that, and if he's being honest with himself, he knows it too," Mariya reassured him. "But I get him. It's sometimes difficult to feel like you live up to expectations. He'll be fine, don't worry. If he hears it from you, it'll be better."\n\nShukhevych nodded. It was important for his son to know that. He didn't want to make him feel like he was inadequate or a failure. He decided to speak with him, and make that clear. Even if Yuriy was not ready for combat, he was still his son."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.17.d: "Roman Shukhevych would have preferred to make this speech in person, in front of a roaring crowd who would cheer his name to the echo. Radio was impersonal and unexciting. But a speech at a rally could only reach a few thousand people. Here, though, millions of Ukrainians would tune in from across the nation, listening to Shukhevych tell of Ukraine's march towards renewal.\n\n"Brothers," he said into the microphone, trying to imagine the people huddled around their radio sets. "For hundreds of years, our great nation has been kept divided by its enemies. We have been partitioned between greedy powers to the west and east, trying to keep us weak and pliable. If we could not fight together, they thought, we could not defeat them. And they were right.\n\n"But we have learned our lesson. Though many of us have found our freedom, there are still Ukrainians languishing under foreign domination. Our comrades in Galicia toil under the Polish jackboot. They have not been forgotten - they have not been abandoned.\n\n"As I speak, our brave soldiers are fighting against the accursed Poles. Our victory is certain, and will come within weeks. This victory will be the first of a truly united Ukraine, and the first of many. Let this be a lesson to those who would seek to divide us. Ukraine is united again. May the Lord show mercy to our enemies, for we will surely show none."\n\nThe muffled claps from outside the booth weren't much, but Shukhevych could imagine the cheers and cries from across Ukraine. There would be no more divisions, no more compromises. Ukraine would live again."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.18.d: "It was at once both a great and terrible moment, thought those on both sides, as the Ukrainian army entered Lviv. The great Galician city had been reclaimed, and while the Ukrainians celebrated, the Poles stood in quiet silence. Quiet fury.\n\nQuiet terror.\n\nThe stories had long since reached the city, accompanied by their storytellers as they had fled the Ukrainian advance. Swollen with refugees, Lviv had heard of countless atrocities inflicted upon their ethnic brethren, and many had expected the fall of the city to be accompanied by a complete sack. A sack not seen in such completion since medieval times.\n\nBut that had not happened. A quick entry, a desultory parade, and the customary establishment of checkpoints and garrisons, yes, but no particular conflict. All agreed that there had clearly been orders given at a high level for restraint of some kind to be held strongly. The population welcomed this, but remained wary. On every tongue was the same word.\n\nYet.\n\nThe occupation had not turned violent. Yet. The looting had not begun. Yet. All knew well how quickly an invading army could turn predatory, and while they hoped with all their might that such would not come to pass, they also began preparing hideouts in their basements. Just in case."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.19.d: "As the sun dipped below the horizon, the once peaceful city of Lviv was transformed into a scene of chaos and destruction. Poland had failed to give in to Shukhevych's demands, and they now pay the price.\n\nIn the heart of Lviv, a pogrom broke out, spurred on by the bitter animosity between the Ukrainians and the Poles. The Ukrainian army, with tacit approval, guided the enraged citizens as they ransacked Polish homes and businesses. The sound of shattering glass and splintering wood filled the air as the mob tore through the city, hell-bent on exacting revenge.\n\nBlood ran through the streets like a river as the bodies of Poles were dragged from their homes and beaten mercilessly by the vengeful mob. The air was thick with acrid smoke as the flames of burning buildings choked the skies above. Families huddled together in terror, praying for an end to the nightmare that had enveloped their lives.\n\nAmid the chaos, a young Polish mother named Helena tried desperately to shield her children from the violence surrounding them. Their home had been invaded, and her husband had been taken away by the mob. All that remained were her two young daughters, who clung to her tightly, their eyes wide with fear. She ran as fast as she could, alongside many others fleeing the violence. They were lost with nowhere to go, only knowing that they should run west as fast as possible. Helena did not look back."

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.20.d: "Screams could be heard from miles away. Birds had ceased to perch in nearby trees, while local villagers had begun packing up to live with relatives. It was a wonder to hear battle-hardened men cry like children until you saw their missing limbs, or what remained of them. Yuriy Shukhevych rarely visited field hospitals. Unlike his father, he was not the populist type who could suck his emotions in and adopt a personable, friendly veneer in the face of abject horror. He was disturbed by the sights, the almost animal-like desperation in the eyes of the men, or the bored glassy-eyed detachment of the doctors.\n\n"How many men are currently here?" Yuriy asked. A black-haired doctor, a, scarred and generally hard-looking man, pondered before grunting out his answer.\n\n"About seven-hundred and fifty, give or take."\n\nYuriy looked into the wide tent; only now did he notice the vast number of men lying on the grass, their wounds looking green and necrotic. Each one looked more perforated than the last, each man's wound telling an equally grim story. He could almost make out a maggot wriggling in one man's eye socket and could see another slightly wriggling his arm stump in a daze. He swallowed some bile and returned his gaze to the doctor, who was emotionless.\n\n"Central command didn't give us enough beds, and the villagers refuse to make us anything. We don't have any medicine, and scarcely any bandages. We have resorted to leaves. They work, for a time at least."\n\nYuriy finally managed to leave the tent, but not before meeting with some men. He had to pull them off a photographer; they all begged him not to publish the photos. Yuriy promised he would prevent it, but later, staring up at the cloudless sky, so discordant with the sight below, he pondered: was it worth it?"

BOV_Shukhevych_buildup.21.d: "Putting his field glasses down, the anger on the Ukrainian commander's face was clear to all around him. They had seen it too. The hills in the distance had clear evidence of fieldworks upon them and, at the crown, the red and white of the Polish flag fluttered in the slight breeze.\n\nIt was not supposed to be this way. The war was not supposed to be a repeat of the previous Polish-Ukrainian wars, no. It was supposed to be modeled on the original German offensives, with quick thrusts overwhelming and encircling disorganized Polish formations, and a quick victory to follow. That was what headquarters had planned, at least. Clearly nobody had thought that the Poles might not cooperate with that vision.\n\nThe commander remembered how quickly those initial thrusts had been swept aside. How quickly they had been blunted. How quickly things had devolved to as they were now, with hard-fought battles against determined and entrenched opposition. Slow advances paid for with great quantities of blood. This was sure to be one of them.\n\nThe commander turned from the damnable flag and stalked back to his post. Those defenses were formidable, and they needed to determine just how many men to send forward, to send to their deaths, in order to give a good chance of taking them. The answer was sure to be too high.\n\nBut the toll would be paid nonetheless."

Lviv is a warzone, five police have been found dead just this month, and another fifteen of our soldiers have been poisoned or in some cases openly beaten to death. The rural areas have seen forty-three farmsteads burned, three outposts attacked and two patrols massacred."\n\nThe chief commander of Ukrainian military forces in Galicia delivered his report in a nervous monotone, while the rest of the Ukrainian general staff, and, most importantly Roman Shukhevych looked on apprehensively. He cleared his throat for the third time in mere minutes and continued.\n\n"Their capabilities overall seem small, however, aid is certainly being provided by their allies across the border. They command quite strong respect amongst the local Poles but are deeply despised by our people. Attempts to disrupt supply lines have been moderately successful, but they remain an issue in the border regions."\n\nThe commander eventually finished his presentation and awkwardly stood, awaiting questions. Roman Shukhevych sat, obviously in deep thought, before slowly rising. He stared directly at the commander, who scarcely made eye contact with him, even though he stood an entire table length away.\n\n"The issue seems clear to me. There are Poles in Galicia. That is the central problem that needs to be solved. No counter-insurgency will work when you have a fifth column always working in support of our enemies. We do not have the means, nor the lack of self-respect to bribe them with trinkets. Bandera made it quite clear; all Poles must die or be driven out. That is the solution. I expect soldiers to be dedicated to this task the moment we leave this room.""

Not a bird chirped, nor were any peasants about scavenging mushrooms or collecting lost pigs.\n\n"The village is just over the hill!"\n\nYuriy began running up the hill, a flood of memories rushing back to him. He remembered gazing down at that village for years, never being able. His father said he'd be able to visit it when Galicia was reclaimed. As he crested the hill, his expectations widened and fell upon every possible fantasy.\n\nThere was nothing beyond the hill.\n\nAll that remained of the village was a charred church. Yuriy turned to his fellow soldiers, who looked on placidly. "Why, why, how..."\n\n"They were all Poles. They got what was coming to them, maybe those who ran like hares will go back to Warsaw, where they belong!" One of the soldiers spat.\n\nYuriy straightened and grimaced.

Devoid of livestock, grains, valuables, and, in many cases, people, the shattered villages tell their own tale. With a desperate desire for victory, driven by the Vozhd's propaganda and pushed into increasing atrocity by orders from home, they have turned Galicia into a near-wasteland.\n\nIt is as yet unclear if their actions will prove a help or a hindrance. While the 'local supply,' as the quartermasters have taken to calling it, has helped keep the speed of advance consistent, the stories of atrocity have spread, drawing condemnation, inspiring low-level partisan activity, and stiffening the resistance of the Polish units encountered.\n\nVictory may well be in the future. But it will have been bought with far more blood and destruction than was required, and a cost will have to be paid."

Honored to have supported the Vozhd's vision with their own blood, and in so doing advance the cause of the Ukrainian people.\n\nAs the night of celebration continues, talk turns to the funerals. In both the same village and the one next over, of the sons who returned in coffins rather than crisp uniforms. They were to be honorably buried in the days to come, their sacrifices praised as necessary in the quest for national revival. A quest that they helped to complete.\n\nFor the spirit of Ukraine has been undeniably reinvigorated. The Polish defeat and the reintegration of Galicia have proven the strength of the people and their determination to overcome years of fracturing and suppression. It has proven the strength of Ukraine. And, of course, it has proven the strength of the Vozhd.\n\nWhich is of course the most important one."

Shukhevych was in a noticeable good mood, as he, Kuk, and Pozychanyuk also took part in the celebrations, in one such gathering with soldiers, citizens, and officers alike.\n\nShukhevych was quite pleased with the resolution of the war. The liberation of Galicia itself had not been in doubt, but there had been a question of how high the cost would be. How much would the Poles dig in? How well could his soldiers execute their plans? Each answer had decidedly swung in their favor.\n\n"A victory well-earned, Roman," Kuk complimented with a smile as he sipped on his drink. "All with barely any blood to show for it. I'm honestly surprised; I expected the Poles to put up more of a fight."\n\n"Aye, so did I," Shukhevych mused, watching the lively crowds. "Perhaps they didn't want to sacrifice their men for a war they knew they'd lose. The outcome is the same regardless. Galicia is ours."\n\n"Now and forever," Kuk raised his glass. "Glory to Ukraine."\n\nShukhevych smiled in return. "Glory to Ukraine."\n\nThe only one of the gathering whose mood didn't match the rest was Pozychanyuk, who couldn't help but think that this could have been resolved without firing a shot. However, he said nothing, for to complain now was pointless. In the eyes of history, Shukhevych was vindicated, and the argument for peace crushed. A reality that they would have to get used to."

No, this time the opposite was occurring. In hushed tones, across thousands of kilometers, villages, and gathering places all, another message was being spread.\n\nHow many had died?\n\nNone could get a straight answer, but all knew it had been far too many. Too many of the scant sons that Ukraine had left after decades of oppression. Too many now buried - or left to rot - in Galicia. And after the discussions on that topic wound down, the logical, and far more dangerous, continuation followed.\n\nWas it worth it?\n\nThe answer was resounding. So many lost for prestige? For nebulous 'unity' already long-since achieved in the minds of many? The conclusion was obvious, and shared. It had been for nothing. For the delusions of their new rulers. For those uninspiring figures - the Vozhd now increasingly included - in whom they were rapidly losing faith."

His presence was so palpable that one felt inclined to speak very carefully, even if he didn't say a word. His cold eyes didn't blink, didn't leave them. It reminded Pozychanyuk of a coiled snake; a wolf appraising prey.\n\nHe had an idea of why. The fighting in Galicia had been ongoing for a few days now. It wasn't going well. Shukhevych had a map with marks on it rolled out on the table. "Fortifications," was Shukhevych's one-word opening. "Each positioned along critical junctures, and erected within the past few weeks. We had not prepared for them, and they've stifled our advance."\n\nThe Vozhd's lips pursed. "We are altering our plans as a result. No doubt the Poles are using the time bought to entrench themselves deeper. Their willingness to hold Galicia is clear."\n\nKuk's mouth clenched shut, and it seemed he was trying not to glare at Pozychanyuk, the latter of whom was remaining very quiet. It was clear that Shukhevych wasn't going to bring up that the decision to launch a surprise invasion had led to this...not yet. At the same time, everyone knew what had led to this.\n\nKuk's advice had proved disastrous. If they'd attempted negotiations, they might have at least not rushed into failure.\n\n"They are preparing for a longer war," Kuk finally said in a tight voice. "We must prepare ourselves for the same. Victory will not come swiftly, but only once the Poles are crushed, wherever they are found."\n\n"Yes," Shukhevych's voice was as cold as his eyes.

And the whispers about it were growing.\n\nWhat strength Ukraine had managed to rebuild, people whispered, after years of oppression and occupation, had been almost completely consumed. Siphoned for a conflict that only weakened the state against the many enemies it had around it. Enemies that all were sure would soon come, enticed by that very weakness itself.\n\nStories of its conduct - of the atrocities - had also begun to spread, from the very soldiers returning home who had committed them. It was madness, people whispered, to act such. They all remembered the brutality and cruelty of their own occupation, and to inflict such pain on another? They knew they had never forgotten the need for vengeance, and were sure that the Poles would not either.\n\nStrongest - and quietest - of all were the whispers about the Vozhd. He had already broken one major promise to the people with the Galician endeavor. They all wondered: What promise would he break next? How would he next deceive the people he claimed to lead?"

Nothing that had been gained, and so much that had been lost.\n\nThe small tombstones seemed to stretch out endlessly, each one a damning indictment of his choice; one he could not hide from. He had sent thousands of young men to die in Galicia for a war that history would rightfully call pointless. And what did he have to show for it? Blood, corpses, and ash. No glory, no victory, and no results.\n\nThere had been hope before this. The people had believed in him; they had believed that Ukraine was the Phoenix which would rise from the dead, and bring life and hope to them again. Now thousands of mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters mourned over those he had sent to die, and cursed him, he who had strangled the hope in the cradle.\n\nAll for nothing.\n\nHe had ordered men to die, all for nothing. He had ordered the Poles exterminated, and seen the world rally to condemn the genocide he had sanctioned. All for nothing. Ukraine was not dead, but their future was. Their best soldiers had died, the unity they had enjoyed was shattered, and the war had left them weakened and vulnerable for the Reich's inevitable return.\n\nAnd so Shukhevych stood before the graves, with only the ghosts to judge him. He knew that he would soon face his Creator, and be judged for what he had done. He only murmured a single sentence, a single prayer, one that was stolen by the wind."

You made us no better than Germany. Did you do it because it was 'necessity,' or because you always wanted to? Did you hate the Germans because of what they did to us, or because they wouldn't accept you as one of their own!"\n\nAt one time, he would have sharply rebuked him, as would the rest of his family - but now no one came to his defense.

He did not need them at all.\n\nThe coming days were going to be difficult. He would face smears, lies, and knives from friend and enemy alike. The former driven by ambition or conscience, the latter by hatred of what he intended to do, or jealousy of what he had achieved despite all odds.\n\nYet he was who Ukraine needed at this juncture of history. Just as Ukraine had needed Ivan Mazepa, they would also need Yaroslav Stetsko. And like Mazepa, they would do everything they could to depose him - a fate he would not suffer. He could not fail. He could not be stopped now. No one else had the will to carry out his vision.\n\nNo, he knew what would come, and what he had to do. The last lingering rays of light faded, and Stetsko returned into his house."

BOV_stetsko_peace.2.t: "Building the Future"
BOV_stetsko_peace.2.d: "There were smiles and handshakes all around as the dozen businessmen in pressed suits were greeted by Yaroslav Stetsko, before they entered the conference room, within which were lush furnishings and the eagle and swastika hung on the wall. Stetsko had made sure that no expense - what little there was - was spared to make the men from Germania feel comfortable.\n\nToday would be very important, there could be no mistakes.\n\nTo his surprise, many of them had been enthusiastic when he'd reached out to them. Within days no fewer than a dozen representatives from industrial and chemical corporations had accepted his offer to present them with his future of Ukraine within the Einheitspakt. Their reaction in-person had been just as enthusiastic, and they expressed interest in what he had to show them.\n\nOnce all of them were seated, and opened with a heil to the Führer, Stetsko began his pitch. "Thank you all for your attendance and attention. I believe there is a bright future between Ukraine and the Reich, with many opportunities for those who pay attention. I will be outlining this future to you - and how each of you can ensure that it not only succeeds, but prospers beyond all expectations."\n\nThe businessmen listened attentively, giving him - or his plans at least - their full attention. Stetsko was rather pleased at the attention - not for a moment was their attention divided. At times it seemed they were more focused on the spreadsheets and numbers - but they were businessmen. Such was to be expected, and once they saw the profit projections, he knew he had them.\n\nIt gave him a renewed sense of optimism about how this would go. If the businessmen were treating him as a proper head of state, that could only portend good things before the leadership of the Reich paid attention."
BOV_stetsko_peace.2.a: "By the time the Führer looked towards Ukraine, they would see his worth."

BOV_stetsko_peace.3.t: "Belated Revelations"
BOV_stetsko_peace.3.d: "Dmytro Maivsky was not one to ignore what was in front of him, and he could not deny the creeping feelings of dread that had grown since Stetsko's ascension.\n\nAnd what he'd seen, and continued to see, unsettled him.\n\nCompared to whom had come before, Stetsko was a necessary change of leadership. Everyone agreed it was necessary, and between those who could possibly fill the role, he fit the bill the best - especially if the only alternative had been Roman. Maivsky had no regrets about supporting him, and ensuring his victory against Klyachkivsky.\n\nHowever, the extent to which Stetsko had relished in the elimination of everyone who had come before concerned him. It wasn't his retribution against Klyachkivsky and his sycophants - it was his actions against anyone who had tangentially been connected to the man's clique, as well as some who hadn't. Considering that all of them had served under Klyachkivsky for many years, Maivsky had some tolerance for integrating some of the less important loyalists. People could change, or not realize there were other options.\n\nStetsko apparently had no such understanding or mercy.\n\nHis actions alone were questionable, but there were other signs that Stetsko's ambitions were not necessarily the best for Ukraine. His violence, paranoia, and dogma, all were reminiscent of the man they had just removed in worrying ways. He didn't like the idea that they had replaced one madman for another-\n\nHe had no more time to ponder on this revelation before the sound of a gun sounded, glass shattered less than a second later, both sounds he barely had time to react to before it was too late. Bullets rent into flesh and send him careening to the ground."
BOV_stetsko_peace.3.a: "He hadn't even had time to feel pain."

BOV_stetsko_peace.4.t: "Covered by the Fire"
BOV_stetsko_peace.4.d: "The falling of the sun portended the coming violence.\n\nThe tensions in the small town had been escalating for weeks now. Maxim had been dreading the moment when everything was going to snap, and he could only fear what would happen next. Nothing good, he knew that much. The most intolerant of the Ukrainians had become bolder and more viscous towards anyone Russian since the UPA had taken over.\n\nThere had been some solidarity between them as fellow men persecuted under German domination. A solidarity which had dissipated; any good Ukrainians had been silenced, driven out, or were now just showing their true colors. It didn't matter - Russians were no longer brethren, but vermin to be exterminated at the urging of their Vozhd.\n\nDarkness fell, and the violence began.\n\nThere had been clashes before; sporadic attacks against isolated Russians. This time the bands were in the dozens, and no longer were their faces hidden. Maxim heard the sounds of glass breaking, the screams of victims, and smelled the smoke. The entire Russian part of the town was burning, and he quickly made to leave.\n\nThere was no time to think, if he stayed he was going to die. The fire, smoke, and roars of the euphoric rioters gave him cover to escape his home unnoticed before the Ukrainians descended. Maxim paused for just a moment as he kept to the edges of the streets, recognizing one of the men in the crowds - a police officer he'd seen earlier in the day.\n\nHe kept his head down, and kept moving, and didn't look back as he said goodbye to the only home he'd known. A home he'd never return to."
BOV_stetsko_peace.4.a: "Ukraine was no longer safe for Russians."

BOV_stetsko_peace.5.t: "Strange Days in Ukraine"
BOV_stetsko_peace.5.d: "Every German settler lived in a constant state of stress and fear since the Ukrainian takeover. Kilian was no exception, but unlike other settlers, he was part of a local militia - a small comfort in times like this. Not that it would stop much if the Ukrainians decided to act.\n\nThe days were long, and like they were waiting for their executions. Fortunately, nothing had happened to them - yet. Part of him wondered at why, but a larger part of him was relieved. His wife had suggested that the Ukrainians knew that attacking Germans would ensure their erasure by the Reich, but Kilian was not convinced.\n\nIf fear of German retaliation was driving their decisions, then they wouldn't have rebelled in the first place, and remained in their place. Instead they'd rebelled, overthrown the rightful government, and now his family could only hope to live another day.\n\nToday might be their last.\n\nHe'd woken to the sounds of cars driving through the streets, each filled with Ukrainian soldiers. He'd wiped his bleary eyes, and instinctively suited to potentially fight. Was it an attack? An invasion? He grabbed his gun, feeling isolated and afraid. His breath came in short bursts, and his knuckles were white.\n\n"Kilian, look!" His wife burst in, a piece of paper in her hand. Exhaling, he quickly took the paper, and read it, growing confused. The Ukrainians were indeed here - but according to the notice, they were here to protect them. From who? Other Ukrainians?\n\nHe met his wife's eyes, and saw the same question and confusion echoed in them. Both of them near the window, they watched more trucks conduct their patrols. It took a few minutes before they started to relax, pondering on this strange turn of events."
BOV_stetsko_peace.5.a: "Perhaps things may be turning around."

BOV_stetsko_peace.6.t: "A New Opening"
BOV_stetsko_peace.6.d: "There was one thing that Stetsko looked forward to at the end of each day. No matter the drudgery or stress of work, there was without reservation one bright spot. A smile, hug, and kiss from his wife when he returned seemed to make the worries of the day fade. No matter what happened, there was always one person who truly understood and loved him without reservation.\n\nThey sat around a small table, eating one of her excellent meals. Stetsko made sure to savor it - Slava could truly cook like no one else. "Work was good?" Slava Stetsko asked as they ate, a questioning look in her eyes.\n\nToday, he was in a good mood for reasons beyond spending time with his wife. He'd been looking forward to sharing the news since he'd left work. It'd taken some time to get things arranged - but it would be worth it for this moment. "Yes. I have some news. We've made the decision to establish some critical roles that need to be filled..."\n\nHe let the sentence hang briefly. "Particularly in the Publications Department. It just so happens we're in need of a lead editor," a teasing note entered his voice. "You wouldn't happen to know one, would you?"\n\nShe paused, the fork halfway to her mouth, quickly grasping what he was saying. Then a wide smile crossed her face. "Well...Are you making me an offer, Mr. Stetsko?"\n\nHe returned the warm smile with a proud one of his own. "I can't think of anyone more suited. It is yours - should you be interested." He only needed to look into her eyes to see her happiness, and the answer she would give.\n\n"I wouldn't have it another way," she told him. "When do I start?""
BOV_stetsko_peace.6.a: "From that point on, both of their days would be a little brighter."

BOV_stetsko_peace.7.t: "One for Another"
BOV_stetsko_peace.7.d: "Once the doors had been smashed open, Yakiv knew it was over. They'd all hoped that their printing operation would remain hidden from the eyes of the UPA, but it had been a naive hope. A few of them had already gone into hiding, but the rest had stuck together and tried to dispose of the evidence of their work.\n\nAll of them expected only one fate for collaborators, especially ones who'd worked under the direction of the Reichskommissariat. However, they must have been followed, because they'd barely been able to start burning the pamphlets and papers before the doors had been smashed open.\n\nThe soldiers had not been gentle, grabbing and shoving them outside, and cordining them off to the side of the building at gunpoint. Several soldiers with engineering equipment entered, who Yakiv knew would be taking apart their printing press.\n\nThey were approached by the sergeant leading the soldiers, a tall and square-faced man who appraised the group. Yakiv wondered if they'd be shot then and there. Instead, the man made a gesture, and weapons were lowered. "You worked for the Germans, correct?"\n\nLying was pointless, so they all nodded; some of them flinching. The sergeant nodded once. "I am going to give you two choices - you work for us now, without question or complaint, and you'll keep your printing operation. Or we put you down here and now." An ugly smile crossed his face. "No one will bat an eye at the deaths of some collaborators."\n\nYakiv looked at his friends, trying to hide his fear and relief. They'd exchanged one master for another - but at least now they could live. If the UPA wanted them to print propaganda? They'd do that. One by one, each of them nodded, and with a smile, the sergeant waved off the guards."
BOV_stetsko_peace.7.a: "Don't stand there gawking - you have work to do!"

BOV_stetsko_peace.8.t: "Let Loose the Dogs"
BOV_stetsko_peace.8.d: "Stetsko stood before the legions of uniformed soldiers; thousands who had been assembled during a cool Ukrainian morning. The first rays of the sun began to spread behind him as he appraised over his army with pride and euphoria.\n\nSo little could compare to this feeling. The power to command armies, and change the course of nations. The power of the man who had saved Ukraine, who had brought purity to it - and who would now make it whole. Today, in the hearts of man and woman, soldier and civilian, they would understand the momentous occasion this was.\n\nHe began his speech with history; a story of a time when Ukraine was whole, before the Poles had stolen their rightful lands of Lviv and Galicia. He painted a picture of their beautiful cities, their colorful fields, and their irreplaceable value to Ukraine as a nation and people. He spoke of their brethren who lived and toiled under Polish rule. Raucous emotion rang through his nasally voice, and many who watched were struck by his inharmonious eloquence.\n\nEventually, Stetsko had set the stage - now it was time to draw the sword. "No more will we allow our cities and lands of Ukrainian history and beauty be held by foreign thieves," Stetsko declared. "No more will our people - brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers - remain under Polish domination. No more will Ukraine remain divided!"\n\nHe repeated it once more, his voice suddenly quiet; intense. "No more."\n\nHe stood as straight as he could make himself, his voice projected as far as it would go. "Today, Ukraine marches to liberate her people! Today, Ukraine reclaims her rightful lands! Today, Ukraine becomes whole!" He ended with a shout, and was answered with a roar that lasted for minutes while Stetsko basked in the noise, a wide smile on his face."
BOV_stetsko_peace.8.a: "The hounds of war howled for release, and in his hands was the leash."

BOV_stetsko_peace.9.t: "Lviv Burns"
BOV_stetsko_peace.9.d: "The ground shook and Urban Tokarczyk peered fearfully outside of his window as the shelling ground to a halt. The Home Army had been driven from the city, and Ukrainian forces ruled the streets. His family had tried to run, but the Ukrainians had surrounded the city before they could get far. Now, they hid in their home and prayed.\n\nHis eyes narrowed as soldiers in dark uniforms kicked in their neighbor's door. At first, he thought they meant to loot the house. A piercing scream and automatic weapons fire put a stop to that delusion. When the men left the house and repeated these actions at the next, he realized their goal. They meant to kill them all. To finish what the Nazi's had started.\n\nLaura! he shouted at his wife in the next room. You must hide! he ordered.\n\nUrban heard his wife usher their daughter into the small crawl space that led to the foundation of their home. Once they had used it to hide weapons for the Home Army, now they had to hide from those they may have considered friends.\n\nUrban did not join his family. He could not. Instead, he went into the small bedroom he shared with his beloved Laura and unlocked the trunk in the closet. From within he pulled the burnished steel of a Błyskawica submachine gun. Laura and Celina would be better served with a distraction. His hands shook as he loaded the weapon.\n\nWith the sound of slaughter to motivate him, he forced the back door open and shouted until his throat burned. When the front door was kicked open, he opened fire without hesitation. Under the floorboards, his family despaired as his body hit the ground with a thud."
BOV_stetsko_peace.9.a: "Sacrifice, without hesitance."

BOV_stetsko_peace.10.t: "A Triumph to Savor"
BOV_stetsko_peace.10.d: "Victory. A feeling to savor and celebrate.\n\nStetsko walked between the ranks of cheering and saluting soldiers as he climbed the podium to deliver his triumph to Ukraine - and the world. As he had expected, the Ukrainians had swiftly destroyed the Poles who had dared try and hold their stolen Ukrainian lands.\n\nAnd each one had paid the ultimate price for their crimes.\n\n"Today, Ukraine is whole!" He began loudly, which was instantly answered by the cheers of his soldiers. He only continued when the noise had lessened. "The brave sons of Ukraine have shown the world their might, and revealed the weakness and degeneracy of the enemy who thought he could keep Ukrainians subordinate!"\n\nEach conclusion was punctuated by brief cheers of approval. "The world will remember this day," Stetsko continued. "History will know that at every moment, our men showed bravery and courage, and sent the sniveling Poles into retreat! Today was a triumph not just over a dead nation, but for all Ukrainians over the Poles who sought to subjugate us."\n\nStetsko smiled widely. "Now they have been beaten, humiliated, and destroyed. They will remember this day, and tremble as they understand that they live only because we allowed it - and should they dare test us, we will march on Warsaw, and finish what we started!"\n\nHis words were drowned out by the baying roars of the soldiers; the men who'd liberated their lands from the enemy. Stetsko today felt only victory and triumph; one he was certain the world was watching. It was a promising sign of things to come."
BOV_stetsko_peace.10.a: "One victory will surely bring many others."

BOV_stetsko_peace.11.t: "Consequences"
BOV_stetsko_peace.11.d: "Tired eyes read the report in front of them for what felt like the thousandth time. The front line was stalling. The Poles proved to be a tougher nut to crack than he had ever hoped. Even now, their forces fought outside Lviv and on the road to Warsaw. Even in Lviv itself and other regions in the countryside, report after report of partisan activity flooded onto his desk. The Polish flame refused to bend to the inevitable wind of the Ukrainian state, and it galled Stetsko to no end.\n\nHis generals sent him good tidings, and yet their advances continued to stall. Yaroslav leaned back in his chair and rested his head in his hands. Every day a new request for more resources would come in, and every day little to no progress was made. Even as the supposedly necessary weapons, vehicles, and more rolled out to the front.\n\nHe let out a long suffering sigh and adjusted himself in the chair. Were there no competent generals in the army? Had there ever been? With no small amount of spite, he remembered some of his old comrades in the OUN. Most were dead now, on his orders. Those snakes in the grass, the false shepherds and Judas', deserved their fate, of that there could be no doubt. Yet, at the back of his mind, he could not help but feel the smallest tinge of regret. Not for his actions, to be sure, but the lack of foresight to ensure competent replacements.\n\nPerhaps, he thought, if they could understand my genius they could have survived. With a derisive shake of his head, he stood and walked out of the room. He was tired, and his wife was undoubtedly waiting for him. The bumbling of his generals could wait until morning"
BOV_stetsko_peace.11.a: "Foresight is the province of better men."

BOV_stetsko_peace.12.t: "Mud and Blood"
BOV_stetsko_peace.12.d: "Rain poured from the skies of Poland as if all the hosts of heaven were in mourning. The trenchwork below Artem's feet was a sodden mess of sucking mud and corpses. A polish mortar had landed directly in the middle of his detachment, and now he was all that remained.\n\nEven as bullets whizzed above his head, Artem Semenovych Denysenko cursed one man to all the circles of hell. The ever glorious leader of Ukraine, Yaroslav Stetsko. The so-called Last hope for a free Ukraine, what a joke.\n\nArtem had grown up under the Nazi boot. His father was murdered for talking back to a German official, his mother died of pneumonia that would have been treated if she was allowed into a hospital. He had survived hell in the camps and the plantations. When the Reichskommissariat fell apart, he had fought with his friends and countrymen to bring about a free Ukraine.\n\nIt was so easy, then, to be blinded by hate for the communists and the liberals. It had been so easy to join the fight against the Poles, they were squatting on Ukrainian land, after all. Artem scoffed, what a fool he was.\n\nHis eyes found the bodies of his squad. He had been transferred after Lviv, and his new squadmates were little more than boys. Fresh faced, yet already robbed of their innocence by years under a foreign boot.\n\nHow many on the other side of the trench wall were the same? How many of those boys had seen their families murdered by Germans and Ukrainians both?\n\nArtem looked into the gray skies and he blinked the rain out of his eyes. He heard the mortar whistling through the air, and he knew in his heart of hearts that it had his name on it. With eyes closed and a small smile, Artem accepted his fate."
BOV_stetsko_peace.12.a: "He would wait for Stetsko in hell."

BOV_stetsko_peace.13.t: "Grim Faces, Hollow Eyes"
BOV_stetsko_peace.13.d: "Stetsko had not reached the heights he now enjoyed without knowing how to read people, and understood where they stood, or how they'd react. Today the mood he sensed from the soldiers and civilians, all who gathered for his victory speech in Galicia was not exactly one of victory, but instead of weariness.\n\nThe war was over, they had won, but it had certainly not been the quick victory they had anticipated. The Poles had put up a fierce resistance, and they had suffered grievous losses before their victory. The land they stood in today had been paid for in the blood of many of Ukraine's sons.\n\nNo amount of words could change that fact. Stetsko planned to attempt a different approach today, a more somber and moderate tone. "My friends, soldiers, and all people of Ukraine, today we celebrate our triumph - and honor the ultimate sacrifice so many made."\n\nThe faces he looked out upon were grim; matching the solemn atmosphere. "There is nothing that can replace the brave men who died in service of their nation - but there is no higher sacrifice one can give. Each man who fell in battle will be remembered as a hero of Ukraine. Let it be clear that their sacrifice has ensured our inevitable triumph."\n\nHe kept talking, but it sounded hollow; the ambitions he had built so carefully were starting to show cracks. Still, he had to press on. "Ukraine is whole once again, and because of this, we can begin working towards the future. Our greatness is yet to come, and because of the sacrifice of so many brave men - we will achieve it soon."\n\nThe people applauded as he finished, but it was moderated; polite. The smiles didn't reach their eyes, nor did the cheers carry vigor. Something uneasy built in Stetsko's stomach, and a sense of foreboding descended."
BOV_stetsko_peace.13.a: "And a fear that the spell had permanently broken."

BOV_stetsko_peace.14.t: "Circling Vultures"
BOV_stetsko_peace.14.d: "Some days Stetsko wondered if he was trapped in a nightmare, but as he awoke each day, it was impossible to escape the fact that things were bad, and could become much worse.\n\nThere was not a day that went by without him hearing of some new resistance against him. Entire units disappearing from patrols. Assassinations of officials or officers. Protests from emboldened citizens demanding answers and 'justice.' Which was to say nothing of the pervasive rumors about his own people plotting behind his back.\n\nMedia that had once been friendly now regularly attacked him. Bodyguards had become a necessity, and he had started rotating them randomly out of a concern that not even they could be trusted. All because of the Galician disaster.\n\nAt worst he had expected the costs to be high. He'd decided to maintain the offensive because as long as they reclaimed Galicia, he could make it work. Yet as the bodies had returned in greater numbers, the frontlines stalled, and the Poles held firm, he had been forced to do the unthinkable.\n\nAdmit defeat. Admit that it had all been for nothing.\n\nWhat did he have to show for the campaign outside of thousands of Ukrainian men dead? Nothing. He had been humiliated and his image destroyed. His allies, cabinet, and generals didn't matter, because he was the face of Ukraine. And now he couldn't move aggressively because there were too many traitors and opportunities who had the knives out.\n\nHe had to just stay alive and on top of the situation for a little while, and things would calm down, and he could figure something out. He was certain he could at least do that - even if it would be difficult."
BOV_stetsko_peace.14.a: "At least it couldn't get much worse."

BOV_stetsko_peace.15.t: "An Untimely Escape"
BOV_stetsko_peace.15.d: "Lebed's face was grim, and that was never something that portended good news. Stetsko had made sure his office was clear, and the two men could speak openly. "He's gone," Lebed said without any preamble. "Pozychanyuk is gone."\n\nStetsko resisted a hiss of frustration at the news of one of Shukhevych's rats escaping their well-deserved fate. "How? Do you have an idea of where he went?"\n\n"Unknown, men are searching as we speak, but..." Lebed paused. "That 'how' is the question. He was just gone when the guards did a routine check. There was no sign of a forced exit, no unlocked doors, no witnesses, nothing. It's like he let himself out."\n\nStetsko's eyebrows furrowed. "We both know that's impossible."\n\n"On his own, I agree," Lebed grimaced. "It seems almost certain that he had help. Only a few people would be able to arrange for something like this. People with authority."\n\nStetsko appraised Lebed closely, picking up the insinuation. "If you are going to make accusations," he said slowly. "Speak carefully."\n\nLebed frowned, seeming to be taken aback. "I will narrow suspects down shortly, but we need to consider that the traitor could be high in the government. And we need to find them now."\n\nStetsko tried to think of who could betray him now - and came up empty. No, everyone was committed and loyal, and Lebed was suggesting they might be traitors? "Conduct your investigation," he said. "But do not accuse the people most loyal to us of treason. Get Pozychanyuk back. That's your priority." Lebed did not seem fully happy, but he did not risk speaking further. He simply nodded and saluted."
